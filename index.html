gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups
on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin
and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can
be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to
hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive
diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse
Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups
with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.

the trace operator from the first-order Sobolev space of mappings

Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space $\smash{\smash{\dot{W}}^{1 - 1/p, p}} (\partial

The traces are extended using a new construction which can be carried out
assuming the absence of the known topological and analytical obstructions. When
$p \ge m$ the same construction provides a Sobolev extension with linear
estimates for maps that have a continuous extension, provided that there are no
known analytical obstructions to such a control.

                                        <span>  In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence
and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity
Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided
techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this
equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the
linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a
Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the
existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is
obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining
analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a
methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$,
enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration,
we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable
soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T>0$) and without capillary
effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and
provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of
solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs,
including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.

we give a spectral result ensuring stability of most of its eigenvalues under
relatively bounded perturbations, and two results controlling the growth of
Sobolev norms when it is subject either to linear unbounded time dependent
perturbations or a small nonlinear Hamiltonian nonlinear perturbation.

anisotropic medium with a conductive boundary. We will assume that the
corresponding far-field pattern is known/measured and we consider two inverse
problems. First, we show that the far-field data uniquely determines the
boundary coefficient. Next, since it is known that anisotropic coefficients are
not uniquely determined by this data we will develop a qualitative method to
recover the scatterer. To this end, we study the so-called monotonicity method
applied to this inverse shape problem. This method has recently been applied to
some inverse scattering problems but this is the first time it has been applied
to an anisotropic scatterer. This method allows one to recover the scatterer
but considering the eigenvalues of an operator associated with the far--field
operator. We present some simple numerical reconstructions to illustrate our
theory in two dimensions. For our reconstructions, we need to compute the
adjoint of the Herglotz wave function as an operator mapping into $H^1$ of a
small ball.

                                        <span>  In dimension three, the existence of global weak solutions to the
axisymmetric simplified Ericksen-Leslie system without swirl is established.
This is achieved by analyzing weak convergence of solutions of the axisymmetric
Ginzburg-Landau approximated solutions as the penalization parameter
$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The proof relies on the one hand on the use of a
blow-up argument to rule out energy concentration off the $z$-axis, which
exploits the topological restrictions of the axisymmetry. On the other hand,
possible limiting energy concentrations on the $z$-axis can be dealt by a
cancellation argument at the origin. Once more, the axisymmetry plays a
substantial role. We will also show that the set of axisymmetric solutions
without swirl $(u,d)$ to the simplified Ericksen-Leslie system is compact under
weak convergence in $L^\infty_tL^2_x\times L^2_tH^1_x$.

existing or state new conjectures in the spectral optimisation of eigenvalues
of the Dirac operator, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We study
the optimality of the regular polygon (respectively, disk) among all polygons
of a given number of sides (respectively, arbitrary sets), subject to area or
perimeter constraints. We consider the three lowest positive eigenvalues and
their ratios. Roughly, we find results analogous to known or expected for the
Dirichlet Laplacian, except for the third eigenvalue which does not need to be
minimised by the regular polygon (respectively, the disk) for all masses. In
addition to the numerical results, a new, mass-dependent upper bound to the
lowest eigenvalue in rectangles is proved and its extension to arbitrary
quadrilaterals is conjectured.

                                        <span>  The evolution of an electrically conducting imcompressible fluid with
nonconstant density can be described by a set of equations combining the
continuity, momentum and Maxwell's equations; altogether known as the
inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes--Maxwell system.
  In this paper, we focus on the global well-posedness of these equations in
two dimensions. Specifically, we are able to prove the existence of global
energy solutions, provided that the initial velocity field belongs to the Besov
space $\dot{B}^{r}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, with $r=-1+\frac{2}{p}$, for some
$p\in (1,2)$, while the initial electromagnetic field enjoys some
$H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ Sobolev regularity, for some $s \geq 2-\frac{2}{p} \in
(0,1)$, and whenever the initial fluid density is bounded pointwise and close
to a nonnegative constant. Moreover, if it is assumed that $s>\frac{1}{2}$,
then the solution is shown to be unique in the class of all energy solutions.
  It is to be emphasized that the solutions constructed here are global and
uniformly bounded with respect to the speed of light $c\in (0,\infty)$. This
important fact allows us to derive the inhomogeneous MHD system as the speed of
light tends to infinity.

                                        <span>  Rarefied gas dynamics is usually described by the Boltzmann equation.
Unfortunately, the expense of evaluating this operator can be very prohibitive.
This made it worthwhile to look for approximations that convey essentially an
equivalent amount of physical information. One widely known approximative
collision operator is the Bathnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) operator. However,
recently, the Foker-Planck approximation has become increasingly popular.
Nevertheless, the modeling of gas mixtures in the context of the kinetic
Fokker-Planck equation has so far only been addressed in a very few papers. In
this paper, we propose a general multi-species Fokker-Planck model. We prove
consistency of our model: conservation properties, positivity of all
temperatures, H-Theorem and the shape of equilibrium as Maxwell distributions
with the same mean velocity and temperature. Moreover, we derive the usual
macroscopic equations.

this context. Moreover, we extend the classical Drop theorem and Petal theorem
to a more generalized setting. We also demonstrate the practical signifcance of
these findings through numerous applications to diverse areas of mathematics.
In particular, in the context of partial differential equations, we explore
their implications on the solution of the Plateau problem, and in control
theory. We also extend the classical Pontyargin maximum principle.

                                        <span>  We prove up to the boundary regularity estimates in Morrey-Lorentz spaces for
weak solutions of the linear system of differential forms with regular
anisotropic coefficients
  \begin{equation*}
  d^{\ast} \left( A d\omega \right) + B^{\intercal}d d^{\ast} \left( B\omega
\right) = \lambda B\omega + f \text{ in } \Omega,
  \end{equation*}
  with either $ \nu\wedge \omega$ and $\nu\wedge d^{\ast} \left( B\omega
\right)$ or $\nu\lrcorner B\omega$ and
  $\nu\lrcorner \left( A d\omega \right)$ prescribed on $\partial\Omega.$ We
derive these estimates from the $L^{p}$ estimates obtained in
\cite{Sil_linearregularity} in the spirit of Campanato's method. Unlike Lorentz
spaces, Morrey spaces are neither interpolation spaces nor rearrangement
invariant. So Morrey estimates can not be obtained directly from the $L^{p}$
estimates using interpolation. We instead adapt an idea of Lieberman
\cite{Lieberman_morrey_from_Lp} to our setting to derive the estimates.
Applications to Hodge decomposition in Morrey-Lorentz spaces, Gaffney type
inequalities and estimates for related systems such as Hodge-Maxwell systems
and `div-curl' systems are discussed.

equilibrium for the two dimensional simplified Ericksen-Leslie's hyperbolic
system for incompressible liquid crystal model, where the direction function of
liquid crystal molecules satisfies a wave map equation with an acoustical
metric. This improves the almost global existence result by Huang-Jiang-Zhao.
As byproducts, we obtain the sharp (same as the linear solution) decay
estimates for the nonlinear velocity and the nonlinear wave part. Moreover the
nonlinear wave part scatters to a linear solution as time goes to infinity.
  The main novelty of this paper is that we uncover a null structure inside the
velocity equation on the Fourier side for the nonlinear interaction between
nonlinear heat equation and nonlinear wave equation.

method approximates the solution to the Schr\"odinger equation by an integral

we revise the standard FGA formula to address the singularities arising in the
higher-order derivatives of coefficients of the associated Hamiltonian flow
that are second-order continuously differentiable or smooth in conventional FGA
analysis. We then establish its convergence to the true solution. Additionally,
we provide some numerical examples to verify the accuracy and convergence
behavior of the frozen Gaussian approximation method.

equations on co-evolving graphs. We describe the connection among vertices
through an edge weight function and we let it evolve in time, coupling its
dynamics with the dynamics on the graph. This is relevant in applications to
opinion dynamics and transportation networks. Existence and uniqueness of
suitably defined solutions is obtained by exploiting the Banach fixed-point
Theorem. We consider different time scales for the evolution of the weight
function: faster and slower than the flow defined on the graph. The former
leads to graphs whose weight functions depend nonlocally on the density
configuration at the vertices, while the latter induces static graphs.
Furthermore, we prove a discrete-to-continuum limit for the PDEs under study as
the number of vertices converges to infinity.

                                        <span>  We develop a boundary integral equation-based numerical method to solve for
the electrostatic potential in two dimensions, inside a medium with piecewise
constant conductivity, where the boundary condition is given by the complete
electrode model (CEM). The CEM is seen as the most accurate model of the
physical setting where electrodes are placed on the surface of an electrically
conductive body, and currents are injected through the electrodes and the
resulting voltages are measured again on these same electrodes. The integral
equation formulation is based on expressing the electrostatic potential as the
solution to a finite number of Laplace equations which are coupled through
boundary matching conditions. This allows us to re-express the solution in
terms of single layer potentials; the problem is thus re-cast as a system of
integral equations on a finite number of smooth curves. We discuss an adaptive
method for the solution of the resulting system of mildly singular integral
equations. This solver is both fast and accurate. We then present a numerical
inverse solver for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which uses our forward
solver at its core. To demonstrate the applicability of our results we test our
numerical methods on an open electrical impedance tomography data set provided
by the Finnish Inverse Problems Society.

                                        <span>  We prove weak uniqueness of mild solutions for a general class of SPDEs on a
Hilbert space. The main novelty is that the drift is only defined on a
Sobolev-type subspace and no H\"older-continuity assumptions are required. This
allows us to cover examples such as equations with divergence-form and
non-divergence-form drift, and Cahn--Hilliard-type equations with possibly
singular perturbations. The main idea is to consider a suitable coloured Wiener
noise so that both the solvability of the SPDE and the regularising effect of
the Kolmogorov operator are preserved via stochastic maximal regularity
results. As a by-product, this also allows us to generalise the available
results of uniqueness by noise for perturbations of the heat equation to higher
dimensions.

                                        <span>  We study the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a
smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with initial velocity $u_0$ square-integrable,
divergence-free and tangent to $\partial \Omega$. We supplement the equations
with the Navier friction boundary conditions $u \cdot n = 0$ and $[(2Su)n +
\alpha u]_{\rm tang} = 0$, where $n$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial
\Omega$, $Su = (Du + (Du)^t)/2$, $\alpha \in C^0(\partial\Omega)$ is the
boundary friction coefficient and $[\cdot]_{\rm tang}$ is the projection of its
argument onto the tangent space of $\partial \Omega$. We prove global existence
of a weak Leray-type solution to the resulting initial-boundary value problem
and exponential decay in energy norm of these solutions when friction is
positive. We also prove exponential decay if friction is non-negative and the
domain is not a solid of revolution. In addition, in the frictionless case
$\alpha = 0$, we prove convergence of the solution to a steady rigid rotation,
if the domain is a solid of revolution. We use the Galerkin method for
existence, Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities, with suitable adaptations to account
for the differential geometry of the boundary, and a global-in-time, integral
Gronwall-type inequality.

such as the abcd Bousssinesq systems or the Green-Naghdi equations. To do so we
consider an appropriate nondimensionalization of these models where two small
parameters are involved: the shallowness parameter {\mu} and a parameter
{\epsilon} which can be interpreted as a Froude number. When parameter
{\epsilon} tends to zero, the surface deformation formally goes to the rest
state, hence the name rigid lid limit. We carefully study this limit for
different topologies. We also provide rates of convergence with respect to
{\epsilon} and a careful attention is given to the dependence on the
shallowness parameter {\mu}.

the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic
space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to
point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero
Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J.
Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343-356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956)
633-636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863-879] gave a very important
progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria
proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557-570]. It is easy to see that our
conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a
generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.

elliptic partial differential operators in n-dimensional Euclidean space, which
improve previous results, with H-J Kuo, through sharp Lp dependence on the
drift coefficient b. As in our previous work, the ellipticity is determined
through the principal coefficient matrix A lying in sub-cones of the positive
cone, which are dual cones of the Garding k-cones. Our main results are maximum
principles for bounded domains, which extend those of Aleksandrov in the case k
= n, together with extensions to unbounded domains, depending on appropriate
integral norms of A, and corresponding local maximum principles. We also
consider applications to local estimates in the uniformly elliptic case,
including extensions of the Krylov-Safonov Holder and Harnack estimates.

\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, and $\chi_i$, $a_i$, $b_i$, $
c_i$ ($i=1,2$) and $\mu,\, \nu, \, \lambda$ are positive constants. This is the
first work on two-species chemotaxis-competition system with singular
sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics. Among others, we prove
that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with
$u_0+v_0\not \equiv 0$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution
$(u(t,x;u_0,v_0),v(t,x;u_0,v_0),w(t,x;u_0,v_0))$ with $u(0,x;u_0,v_0)=u_0(x)$
and $v(0,x;u_0,v_0)=v_0(x)$ provided that $\min\{a_1,a_2\}$ is large relative
to $\chi_1,\chi_2$ and $u_0+v_0$ is not small. Moreover, under the same
condition, we prove that \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{t\to\infty} \|u(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)+v(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)\|_\infty\le M^*,
\end{equation*} and \begin{equation*}
  \liminf_{t\to\infty} \inf_{x\in\Omega}(u(t,x,u_0,v_0)+v(t,x;u_0,v_0))\ge m^*,
\end{equation*} for some positive constants $M^*,m^*$ independent of $u_0,v_0$,
the latter is referred to as combined pointwise persistence.

gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups
on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin
and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can
be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to
hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive
diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse
Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups
with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.

                                        <span>  In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two
nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points,
each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. This
problem, which has a long history, has found applications in science and
technology. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with
possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of
uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. To the best of our
knowledge these fundamental issues have not received much attention. In
particular, we present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at
most) uniqueness of a BAP relative to these subsets. These conditions are
related to the structure of the boundaries of the subsets, their relative
orientation, and the structure of the unit sphere of the space. In addition, we
present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP, possibly without
convexity . Our results allow us to significantly extend the horizon of the
recent alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke (A-S-HLWB)
algorithm [Censor, Mansour and Reem, The alternating simultaneous
Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation
pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets, arXiv:2304.09600 (2023)]
for solving the BAP problem.

The traces are extended using a new construction which can be carried out
assuming the absence of the known topological and analytical obstructions. When
$p \ge m$ the same construction provides a Sobolev extension with linear
estimates for maps that have a continuous extension, provided that there are no

                                        <span>  In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence
and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity
Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided
techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this
equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the
linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a
Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the
existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is
obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining
analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a
methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$,
enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration,
we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable
soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T>0$) and without capillary
effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and
provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of
solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs,
including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we explore various equivalences of Ekeland's variational
principle within the framework of group-invariant mappings. We introduce and
analyze several key theorems, including the Drop theorem, the Petal theorem,
Caristi-Kirk fxed-point theorem, and Takahashi's theorem, all of them within
this context. Moreover, we extend the classical Drop theorem and Petal theorem
to a more generalized setting. We also demonstrate the practical signifcance of
these findings through numerous applications to diverse areas of mathematics.
In particular, in the context of partial differential equations, we explore
their implications on the solution of the Plateau problem, and in control
theory. We also extend the classical Pontyargin maximum principle.

which states that a symmetric and continuous kernel is positive definite if and
only if it is integrally positive definite. More precisely, we extend the
result from real-valued kernels on compact intervals to matrix-valued kernels
on separable metric spaces. We also demonstrate the applications of the
generalized theorem to the field of convex optimization.

                                        <span>  By generalizing the overspill principle towards directed sets, a new and
extensive formalism is developed for monads and galaxies in non-standard
enlargements. It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using
order-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties
associated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all
monads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is
introduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally
convex) topological vector spaces and their properties. Local properties and
completeness can be defined and characterized effortlessly. Duality theory is
studied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate brief and
insightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck
completeness without any technicalities.

that $|f|=|g|$ on a set $A$. We first prove that there exists $c$ in the unit
circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in
$\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$.
The same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and
$A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not.
We also provide sequential versions of the previous results and analyse the
case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally we examine the situation when there is equality on
two distinct circles in the disc, proving a result or counterexample for each
possible configuration.

broad class of Fr\'{e}chet spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable functions
on Lie groups globally defined via families of weight functions.

We show that in the half-plane and in a disk, collapses of point-vortices with
the boundary in finite time are impossible, hence the solution of the dynamics
is global in time. We also give some necessary conditions for the existence of
collapses with the boundary in general smooth bounded domains, in particular
that the trajectory of at least one point-vortex has no limit. Some minor
results are obtained with signed intensities.

described by the two-dimensional Euler-Boussinesq equations in a periodic
channel. Through a perturbative analysis of the hydrostatic homogeneous
setting, we exhibit a stratified steady state violating the Miles-Howard
criterion and generating a growing mode, both for the linearized hydrostatic
and non-hydrostatic equations. By leveraging long-wave nonlinear instability
for the original Euler-Boussinesq system, we demonstrate the breakdown of the
hydrostatic limit around such unstable profiles. Finally, we establish the
generic nonlinear ill-posedness of the limiting hydrostatic system in Sobolev

solutions to nonlocal equations in $C^{k,\gamma}$ domains which satisfy local
Neumann conditions on the boundary. Such solutions typically blow up at the
boundary like $v \asymp d^{s-1}$ and are sometimes called large solutions. In
this setup we prove optimal regularity results for the quotients $v/d^{s-1}$,
depending on the regularity of the domain and on the data of the problem. The
results of this article will be important in a forthcoming work on nonlocal
free boundary problems.

Neumann boundary conditions. For a certain class of bounded, simply connected
planar domains we prove monotonicity properties of the first eigenfunction. As
a consequence, we establish a variant of the hot spots conjecture for mixed
boundary conditions. Moreover, we obtain an inequality between the lowest
eigenvalue of this mixed problem and the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding
dual problem where the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are
interchanged. The proofs are based on a novel variational principle, which we
establish.

approach to simulate complex physical systems on the basis of both data
observations and physical models. In this work, we investigate the use of PINNs
for various applications in aerodynamics and we explain how to leverage their
specific formulation to perform some tasks effectively. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of PINNs to construct parametric surrogate models, to
achieve multiphysic couplings and to infer turbulence characteristics via data
assimilation. The robustness and accuracy of the PINNs approach are analysed,
then current issues and challenges are discussed.

Kolmo\-gorov-Fokker-Planck equations with rough (measurable) coefficients and
local or integral diffusion on finite and infinite time strips. In the local
case, that is to say when the diffusion operator is of differential type, we
prove $\L^2$ decay using Davies' method and the conservation property. We also
prove that the existence of a generalized fundamental solution with the
expected pointwise Gaussian upper bound is equivalent to Moser's
$\L^2-\L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions to the equation and its
adjoint. When coefficients are real, this gives the existence and uniqueness of
such a generalized fundamental solution and a new and natural way to obtain
pointwise decay.

identify a notion of weak solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations with
(local or integral) diffusion and rough (measurable) coefficients under minimal
requirements. We prove their existence and uniqueness for a large class of
source terms, first in full space for the time, position and velocity variables

solutions for a linear elliptic system coupled with a nonlinear Maxwell-type
system defined on Lipschitz domains. The regularity result is established using
a modified finite difference approach. These adjusted finite differences
involve inner variations in conjunction with a Piola-type transformation to
preserve the curl-structure within the matrix Maxwell system. The proposed
method is further applied to the linear relaxed micromorphic model.
  As a result, for a physically nonlinear version of the relaxed micromorphic
model, we demonstrate that for arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, the displacement
vector $u$ belongs to $H^{\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$, and the
microdistortion tensor $P$ belongs to $H^{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$ while
$\Curl P$ belongs to $H^{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(\Omega)$.

applications involving flows of fluid-like materials with complex
micro-structure. A well-developed mathematical theory for the most of these
classical fluid models is however missing. The main purpose of this study is to
provide a complete proof of long-time and large-data existence of weak
solutions to unsteady internal three-dimensional flows of Giesekus fluids
subject to a no-slip boundary condition. As a new auxiliary tool, we provide
the identification of certain biting limits in the parabolic setting, presented
here within the framework of evolutionary Stokes problems. We also generalize
the long-time and large-data existence result to higher dimensions, to
viscoelastic models with multiple relaxation mechanisms and to viscoelastic
models with different type of dissipation.

                                        <span>  We propose the first generalization of Sontag s universal controller to
systems not affine in the control, particularly, to PDEs with boundary
actuation. We assume that the system admits a control Lyapunov function (CLF)
whose derivative, rather than being affine in the control, has either a
depressed cubic, quadratic, or depressed quartic dependence on the control. For
each case, a continuous universal controller that vanishes at the origin and
achieves global exponential stability is derived. We prove our result in the
context of convectionreaction-diffusion PDEs with Dirichlet actuation. We show
that if the convection has a certain structure, then the L2 norm of the state
is a CLF. In addition to generalizing Sontag s formula to some non-affine
systems, we present the first general Lyapunov approach for boundary control of
nonlinear PDEs. We illustrate our results via a numerical example.

                                        <span>  We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the
one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation subject to intermittent sensing.
We assume that we measure the state of this spatio-temporal equation on a given
spatial subdomain during certain intervals of time, while we measure the state
on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining intervals of time. As a
result, we assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and
force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains.
Throughout the study, the destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be
space-dependent and bounded but unknown. Adaptive boundary controllers are
designed under different assumptions on the forcing term. In particular, when
the forcing term is null, we guarantee global exponential stability of the
origin. Furthermore, when the forcing term is bounded and admits a known upper
bound, we guarantee input-to-state stability, and only global uniform ultimate
boundedness is guaranteed when the upper bound is unknown. Numerical
simulations are performed to illustrate our results

CLBF) that aid in constrained control problems such as reach-avoid problems.
Harmonic CLBFs exploit the maximum principle that harmonic functions satisfy to
encode the properties of control Lyapunov barrier functions (CLBFs). As a
result, they can be initiated at the start of an experiment rather than trained
based on sample trajectories. The control inputs are selected to maximize the
inner product of the system dynamics with the steepest descent direction of the
harmonic CLBF. Numerical results are presented with four different systems
under different reach-avoid environments. Harmonic CLBFs show a significantly
low risk of entering unsafe regions and a high probability of entering the goal
region.

                                        <span>  We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to
partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions
of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the
maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we
demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on
hypergraphs.

corresponding to the logarithmic symbol $\log(1 + |\xi|^2)$, which is a
singular integral operator given by $$(\mathcal{I}-\Delta)^{\log}u(x)

to isentropic Euler system in multi dimension. Sideris [Comm. Math. Phys. 1985]
proved the blow up of smooth solutions when initial data satisfies an `integral
condition'. We show that a $C^1$ solution of isentropic Euler equation breaks
down if (i) gradient of initial velocity has a negative real eigenvalue at some
point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and (ii) Hessian of initial density satisfies a
smallness condition in Sobolev space. Our proof also works for the data which
fails to satisfy the above-mentioned `integral condition'. Furthermore, we
prove the global existence of smooth solution when (i) eigenvalues of gradient
of initial velocity have non-negative real-part and (ii) initial density
satisfies a smallness condition. This extends the global existence result of
[Grassin, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 1998]. Another goal of this article is to
study the breakdown of continuous weak solutions of isentropic Euler equations.
We are able to show that the `integral condition' of Sideris can cause the
breakdown of continuous solutions in finite time. This improves the blow up
result of Sideris from $C^1$ to continuous space.

investigated in this paper. An appropriate boundary feedback law consisting of
a linear combination of a damping mechanism and a delay term is designed. Then,
first, considering time-varying delay feedback together with a smallness
restriction on the length of the spatial domain and the initial data, we show
that the problem under consideration is well-posed. The proof combines Kato's
approach and the fixed-point argument. Last but not least, we prove that the
energy of the linearized KdV-KdV system decays exponentially by employing the
Lyapunov method.

                                        <span>  This paper presents $\Psi$-GNN, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach
for solving the ubiquitous Poisson PDE problems with mixed boundary conditions.
By leveraging the Implicit Layer Theory, $\Psi$-GNN models an "infinitely" deep
network, thus avoiding the empirical tuning of the number of required Message
Passing layers to attain the solution. Its original architecture explicitly
takes into account the boundary conditions, a critical prerequisite for
physical applications, and is able to adapt to any initially provided solution.
$\Psi$-GNN is trained using a "physics-informed" loss, and the training process
is stable by design, and insensitive to its initialization. Furthermore, the
consistency of the approach is theoretically proven, and its flexibility and
generalization efficiency are experimentally demonstrated: the same learned
model can accurately handle unstructured meshes of various sizes, as well as
different boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, $\Psi$-GNN is the
first physics-informed GNN-based method that can handle various unstructured
domains, boundary conditions and initial solutions while also providing
convergence guarantees.

obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^{d+r}$ for $r,d \geq 1$ of the form $\Omega \times
\mathbb{R}^r$, where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As
a main result a von-Neumann-trace formula for the relative trace is obtained in
this setting. As a special case we obtain a dimensional reduction formula for
the Casimir energy for the massive and massless scalar fields in this
configuration $\Omega \times \mathbb{R}^r$ per unit volume in $\mathbb{R}^r$.

equation $$\Delta_pv+b|\nabla v|^q+cv^r =0$$ defined on a complete Riemannian
manifold $(M,g)$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below, where $p>1$, $q,\, r,
\, b$ and $c$ are some real constants. If $p>1$ is given and $bc\geq 0$, we
provide a new routine to give some regions of $(q, r)$ such that the
Cheng-Yau's logarithmic gradient estimates hold true exactly on such given
regions. In particular, we derive the upper bounds of the constants $c(n, p, q,
r)$ in the Cheng-Yau's gradient estimates for the entire solutions to the above
equation. As applications, we reveal some universal local and global properties
of positive solutions to the equation. On the other hand, we extend some
results due to \cite{MR1879326} to the case the domain of the equation is a
complete manifold and obtain wider ranges of $(q,r)$ for Liouville properties.

some Liouville-type theorems, Harnack inequalities and some local estimates
near singularities for positive solutions. Some of our results are new even in
the case the domain is an Euclidean space and $p=2$.

additive forcing $\xi \in C^{\alpha-2}$, in the full sub-critical regime
$\alpha \in (0,1)$. We are inspired by Hairer's regularity structures, however
we work with a more parsimonious model indexed by multi-indices rather than
trees. This allows us to capture additional symmetries which play a crucial
role in our analysis. Assuming bounds on this model, which is modified in
agreement with the concept of algebraic renormalization, we prove local a
priori estimates on solutions to the quasi-linear equations modified by the
corresponding counter terms.

the other particles to jump in the direction of the barrier and this feedback
mechanism leads to the possibility that the system can exhibit contagious
blow-ups. Using a fixed-point argument we construct a differentiable solution
up to a first explosion time. Our main contribution is a proof of uniqueness in
the class of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions, which confirms the validity of related
propagation-of-chaos results in the literature. We extend the allowed initial
conditions to include densities with any power law decay at the boundary, and
connect the exponent of decay with the growth exponent of the solution in small
time in a precise way. This takes us asymptotically close to the control on
initial conditions required for a global solution theory. A novel minimality
result and trapping technique are introduced to prove uniqueness.

of hyper-recurrent operators and establish robust connections with quasi-rigid
operators. For example, we prove that a recurrent operator on a separable
Banach space is quasi-rigid if and only if it is a linear factor of a
hyper-recurrent operator, and show that the quasi-rigid operators found in
Costakis, Manoussos and Parissis's work, along with many others, are, in fact,
hyper-recurrent operators. Furthermore, we provide a negative answer, using a
class of operators introduced by Tapia, to the question by Costakis et al.
whether $T \oplus T$ is recurrent whenever $T$ is.

is called {\it $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive} if for any sequence
$(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $y$ in $K$, one has $\|(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n Tx_i -Ty\|\leq
\|(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - y\|$. As a subsclass of nonexpansive maps, the FPP
for such maps is well-established in a great variety of spaces. The main result
of this paper is a fixed point result relating
$\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases
with not-so-large basis constants. As a result, we deduce that every Banach
space with weak Banach-Saks property has the fixed point property for
$\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.

Kalton-Peck spaces $Z_p$ for $1<p<\infty$ admit an inevitable biorthogonal
system. Therefore, we may add this classic family to the list of arbitrarily
distortable spaces.

optimal constants in H\"older inequality for the weak Schatten classes of
compact operators. In this note we observe that these constants, by introducing
the modified weak Schatten quasi-norms, can be renormalised so that the
original Simon's conjecture (with optimal constant 1) does hold. We also
provide an unexpectedly simple proof for the modified H\"older inequality and
its sharpness.

                                        <span>  Using a method of factorization and by introducing a generalized discrete
Dirichlet's Laplacian matrix $(-\Delta_{\Lambda})$, we establish an extended
improved discrete Hardy's inequality and Rellich inequality in one dimension.
We prove that the discrete Copson inequality (E.T. Copson, \emph{Notes on a
series of positive terms}, J. London Math. Soc., 2 (1927), 9-12.) in
one-dimension admits an improvement. We also prove that the improved Copson's
weights are optimal (in fact \emph{critical}). It is shown that improvement of
the Knopp inequalities (Knopp in J. London Math. Soc. 3(1928), 205-211 and
5(1930), 13-21) lies on improvement of the Rellich inequalities. Further, an
improvement of the generalized Hardy's inequality (Hardy in Messanger of Math.
54(1925), 150-156) in a special case is obtained.

problems driven by fractional powers of nondivergence form elliptic operators
$(-a^{ij}(x) \partial_{ij})^s$, for $0<s<1$, in bounded domains under minimal
regularity assumptions on the coefficients $a^{ij}(x)$. Solutions to the
fractional problem are characterized by a local degenerate/singular extension
problem. We introduce a novel notion of viscosity solutions for the extension
problem and implement Caffarelli's perturbation methodology in the
corresponding degenerate/singular Monge--Amp\`ere geometry to prove Schauder
estimates in the extension. This in turn implies interior Schauder estimates
for solutions to the fractional nonlocal equation. Furthermore, we prove a new
Hopf lemma, the interior Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity in the
Monge--Amp\`ere geometry for viscosity solutions to the extension problem.

describing various long waves in dispersive systems. In this article, we prove
that in a certain scaling regime, a large class of rough solutions to the
Boussinesq equation are approximated by the sums of two counter-propagating
waves solving the KdV equations. It extends the earlier result by
\cite{Schneider1998} to slightly more regular than $L^2$-solutions. Our proof
is based on robust Fourier analysis methods developed for the low regularity
theory of nonlinear dispersive equations.

smooth solution for all smooth, finite energy initial data is a Millennium
Prize problem. One of the main difficulties of this problem is that the
Navier-Stokes equations are actually a system of semilinear heat equations
rather than a single equation. In this paper, we discover a remarkable hidden
symmetry of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Under this symmetric
reduction, the system reduces to a single scalar semilinear heat equation. The
symmetry also holds for the 3D incompressible Euler equations.

                                        <span>  To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to consider the stable
solution and extremal solution for the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation:
$(-\Delta)_p^s u= \lambda f(u),\; u> 0 ~\text{in}~\Omega;\; u=0\;\text{in}~
\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega$, where $p>1$, $s\in (0,1)$, $N>sp$, $\lambda>0$
and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain with continuous boundary. We first construct
the notion of stable solution, and then we prove that when $f$ is of class
$C^1$, nondecreasing and such that $f(0)>0$ and $\underset{t\to
\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(t)}{t^{p-1}}=\infty$, there exists an extremal parameter
$\lambda^*\in (0, \infty)$ such that a bounded minimal solution $u_\lambda$
exists if $\lambda\in (0, \lambda^*)$, and no bounded solution exists if
$\lambda>\lambda^*$, no $W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ solution exists if in addition
$f(t)^{\frac{1}{p-1}}$ is convex. Moreover, this family of minimal solutions
are stable, and nondecreasing in $\lambda$, therefore the extremal function
$u^*:=\underset{\lambda\to\lambda^*}{\lim}u_\lambda$ exists.
  For the regularity of the extremal function, we first show the
$L^r$-estimates for the equation $(-\Delta)_p^su=g$ with $g\in W_0^{s,
p}(\Omega)^*\cap L^q(\Omega)$, $q\ge 1$. When $f$ is a power-like nonlinearity,
we derive the $W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ regularity of $u^*$ in all dimension and
$L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ regularity of $u^*$ in some low dimensions. For more
general nonlinearities, when $f$ is class of $C^2$ and such that some convexity
assumptions, then $u^*\in W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ if $N<sp(1+\frac{p}{p-1})$ and
$u^*\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ if $N<\frac{sp^2}{p-1}$. Furthermore, when the
limit $\tau=\underset{t\to\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(t)f''(t)}{f'(t)^2}$ exists and
$\tau>\frac{p-2}{p-1}$, the results above can be improved as: $u^*\in
W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ for all dimensions, and $u^*\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ if
$N<sp+\frac{4sp}{p-1}$.

                                        <span>  This article is devoted to investigate the singular profile of the free
boundary of two-dimensional incompressible inviscid fluid with external force
near the stagnation point. More precisely, given an external force with some
polynomial type decay close to the stagnation point, the singular profile of
the free boundary at stagnation point possible are corner wave, flat and cusp
singularity. Through excluding the cusp and flat singularity, we know the only
singular profile is corner wave singularity, and the corner depends on the
decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point. The analysis depends on
the geometric method to a class of Bernoulli-type free boundary problem with
given degenerate gradient function on free boundary. This work is motivated by
the significant work [E. V$\breve{a}$rv$\breve{a}$ruc$\breve{a}$ and G. Weiss,
Acta Math, 206, 363-403, (2011)] on Stokes conjecture to the incompressible
inviscid fluid acted on by gravity.

                                        <span>  Recently an algorithm was given in [Garde & Hyv\"onen, SIAM J. Math. Anal.,
2024] for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^2$ perturbation from linearised
data in the two-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem. It was a simple
forward substitution method based on a 2D Zernike basis. We now consider the
three-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem in a ball, and use a 3D Zernike
basis to obtain a method for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^3$
perturbation from linearised data. The method is likewise a forward
substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement.
Moreover, the 3D method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary
measurements for exact reconstruction, compared to a full $L^2$ basis of
current densities.

                                        <span>  In 1994, Vel\'{a}zquez constructed a countable family of complete
hypersurfaces flowing in $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ $(N\geq 4)$ by mean curvature, each
of which develops a type II singularity at the origin in finite time. Later Guo
and Sesum showed that for a non-empty subset of Vel\'{a}zquez's solutions, the
mean curvature blows up near the origin, at a rate smaller than that of the
second fundamental form; recently Stolarski proved another subset of these
solutions has bounded mean curvature up to the singular time. In this paper, we
follow their arguments to construct compact mean curvature flow solutions in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n\geq 8)$ with bounded mean curvature.

$(M,g)$. We seek to get an $L^p$ restriction bounds of the Neumann data $
\lambda^{-1} \partial_\nu u_{\lambda}\,\vline_\gamma$ along a unit geodesic

estimate of the norm of a Fourier integral operator and show that such bound is
$O(\lambda^{-\frac{1}p+\frac{3}2})$. The Van De Corput theorem (Lemma 2.1)
plays the crucial role in our proof. Moreover, this upper bound is shown to be
optimal.

a nodal ground state solution to the problem above, based on variational
methods and minimization of the associated energy functional $\mathcal{E}\colon

from the well-known nodal Nehari manifold due to the nonlocal character of the
problem.

                                        <span>  We characterise the chain rule symmetry for the geometric stochastic heat
equations in the full subcritical regime for Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises.
We show that the renormalised counter-terms that give a solution invariant
under changes of coordinates are generated by iterations of covariant
derivatives. The result was known only for space-time white noises, with a very
specific proof that so far could not be extended to the general case. The key
idea of the present paper is to change the perspective on several levels and to
use ideas coming from operad theory and homological algebra. Concretely, we
introduce the operad of Christoffel trees that captures the counter-terms of
the renormalised equation; our main new insight is to describe the space of
invariant terms homologically, using a suitable perturbation of the
differential of the operadic twisting of that operad. As a consequence, we
obtain the correct renormalisation for the quasi-linear KPZ equation in the
subcritical regime completing the programme started by Hairer and Gerencser.
Previously, the main algebraic tool used in the study of singular SPDEs were
Hopf algebras of decorated trees; our work shows that operad theory and
homological algebra add new powerful tools with immediate applications to open
problems that were out of reach by other methods.

operators to Dirac operators with zigzag type boundary conditions. We prove
that the convergence holds in strong but not in norm resolvent sense. Moreover,
we show that the only obstruction for having norm resolvent convergence is the
existence of an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity for the limiting operator.
More precisely, we prove the convergence of the resolvents in operator norm
once projected into the orthogonal of the corresponding eigenspace.

using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders
using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of
Hamilton.

jump measure outside balls and a local energy comparability condition. We
establish the robustness of our results, ensuring that the constants in our
estimates remain bounded, provided that the order of the scale function

maintains a certain distance from zero.

potential, a key equation in the mathematical setup for nonlinear Anderson
localization. Our study comprises two main parts: new optimal results on the
well-posedness analysis on the PDE level, and subsequently a new efficient
numerical method, its convergence analysis and simulations that illustrate our
analytical results. In the analysis part, our results focus on understanding
how the regularity of the solution is influenced by the regularity of the
potential, where we provide quantitative and explicit characterizations.
Ill-posedness results are also established to demonstrate the sharpness of the
obtained regularity characterizations and to indicate the minimum regularity
required from the potential for the NLS to be solvable. Building upon the
obtained regularity results, we design an appropriate numerical discretization
for the model and establish its convergence with an optimal error bound. The
numerical experiments in the end not only verify the theoretical regularity
results, but also confirm the established convergence rate of the proposed
scheme. Additionally, a comparison with other existing schemes is conducted to
demonstrate the better accuracy of our new scheme in the case of a rough
potential.

approximation of a time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation in a convex
polyhedral domain, where the given driving force is a function of space. Taking
into account the limited smoothing properties of the model, and considering an
appropriate splitting of the errors, we employed a sequence of clever energy
arguments to show optimal convergence rates with respect to both approximation
properties and regularity results. In particular, error bounds for both primary
and secondary variables are derived in $L^2$-norm for cases with smooth and
nonsmooth initial data. We further investigate a fully implicit time-stepping
scheme based on a convolution quadrature in time generated by the backward
Euler method. Our main result provides pointwise-in-time optimal $L^2$-error
estimates for the primary variable. Numerical examples are then presented to
illustrate the theoretical contributions.

homogeneous case. We show short time propagation of smallness in $L^p$ norms
for $p>3/2$ and instantaneous regularization in Sobolev spaces. This yields new
short time quantitative a priori estimates that are unconditional near
equilibrium. We combine these estimates with existing literature on global
well-posedness for regular data to extend the well-posedness theory to small
$L^p$ data with $p$ arbitrarily close to $3/2$. The threshold $p = 3/2$ agrees
with previous work on conditional regularity for the Landau equation in the far
from equilibrium regime.
  In light of the monotonicity of the Fisher information shown in the recent
preprint [arXiv:2311.09420], our primary nonlinear regularization estimate
holds even in the far-from-equilibrium regime. As a consequence, we obtain
exponential convergence to equilibrium for suitably localized solutions in
every Sobolev norm.

the 2000s there have been thousands of contributions using them as correct
framework; they range from PDEs, pseudodifferential operators, quantum
mechanics, signal analysis. This justifies a deep study of such spaces and the
related Wiener ones. Recently, metaplectic Wigner distributions, which contain
as special examples the $\tau$-Wigner distributions, the ambiguity function and
the Short-time Fourier transform, have proved to characterize modulation
spaces, under suitable assumptions. We investigate the metaplectic action which
is hidden in their construction and guarantees equivalent (quasi-)norms for
such spaces. We add a new result on this topic and conclude with an exhaustive
vision of these characterizations. Similar results hold for the Wiener amalgam
ones.

steady isentropic Euler system with an external force in a rectangular cylinder
under the three-dimensional perturbations for the incoming supersonic flow, the
exit pressure and the external force. The external force has a stabilization
effect on the transonic shocks in flat nozzles and the transonic shock is
completely free, we do not require it passing through a fixed point. By
utilizing the deformation-curl decomposition to decouple the hyperbolic and
elliptic modes in the steady Euler system effectively and reformulating the
Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the transonic shock problem is reduced to a
deformation-curl first order system for the velocity field with nonlocal terms
supplementing with an unusual second order differential boundary condition on
the shock front, an algebraic equation for determining the shock front and two
transport equations for the Bernoulli's quantity and the first component of the
vorticity.

                                        <span>  For a class of external forces, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
smooth transonic flows to the one dimensional steady Euler system with an
external force, which is subsonic at the inlet and flows out at supersonic
speed after smoothly accelerating through the sonic point. We then investigate
the structural stability of the one-dimensional smooth transonic flows with
positive acceleration under axisymmetric perturbations of suitable boundary
conditions, and establish the first existence and uniqueness result for smooth
axisymmetric transonic irrotational flows. The key point lies on the analysis
of a linear second order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed differential equation of
Keldysh type with a singular term. Some weighted Sobolev spaces $H_r^m(D)
(m=2,3,4)$ are introduced to deal with the singularities near the axis.
Compared with the stability analysis in the two dimensional case by Weng and
Xin (arXiv:2309.07468), there are several interesting new observations about
the structure of the linear mixed type equation with a singular term which play
crucial roles in establishing the $H^4_r(D)$ estimate.

Alt-Phillips type problem \[ -\Delta u =

inhomogeneous character of the right hand-side, which makes difficult to adapt
in a standard way classical tools from free-boundary problems, such as
monotonicity formulas and blow-up arguments. Our main results are: the local
behavior of solutions close to the nodal set; the complete classification of
the admissible vanishing orders, and estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of
the singular set, for local minimizers; the existence of degenerate (not
locally minimal) solutions.

                                        <span>  In Gel'fand's inverse problem, one aims to determine the topology,
differential structure and Riemannian metric of a compact manifold $M$ with
boundary from the knowledge of the boundary $\partial M,$ the Neumann
eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ and the boundary values of the eigenfunctions
$\varphi_j|_{\partial M}$. We show that this problem has a stable solution with
quantitative stability estimates in a class of manifolds with bounded geometry.
More precisely, we show that finitely many eigenvalues and the boundary values
of corresponding eigenfunctions, known up to small errors, determine a metric
space that is close to the manifold in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We provide
an algorithm to construct this metric space. This result is based on an
explicit estimate on the stability of the unique continuation for the wave
operator.

with vertical viscosity and zero diffusivity, which is a nonlinear system with
partial dissipation arising in atmospheric sciences and oceanic circulation.
The domain is taken as $\mathbb{R}_+^2$ with Navier-type boundary. We prove the
nonlinear stability of the approximate solution constructed by boundary layer
expansion in conormal Sobolev space. The expansion order and convergence rates
for the inviscid limit are also identified in this paper. Our paper extends a
partial zero-dissipation limit results of Boussinesq system with full
dissipation by Chae D. $[Adv. Math. 203, no. 2, 2006]$ in the whole space to
the case with partial dissipation and Navier boundary in the half plane.

property $(T)$ and Burger and Monod's property $(TT)$. In this paper, we
improve Ozawa's result by showing that any simple algebraic group of rank $\geq
2$ over a local field has property $(TTT)$. We also show that lattices in a
second countable locally compact group inherits property $(TTT)$. Finally, we
study to what extent Lie groups with infinite center fail to have properties
$(TT)$ and $(TTT)$.

                                        <span>  Douglas and Rudin proved that any unimodular function on the unit circle $\T$
can be uniformly approximated by quotients of inner functions. We extend this
result to the operator-valued unimodular functions defined on the boundary of
the open unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$. Our proof technique combines the spectral
theorem for unitary operators with the Douglas-Rudin theorem in the scalar case
to bootstrap the result to the operator-valued case. This yields a new proof
and a significant generalization of Barclay's result [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.
2009] on approximation of matrix-valued unimodular functions on $\T$.

                                        <span>  This article intends to initiate an investigation into the structure of
$M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, where $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ denotes the
Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc
$\mathbb{D}$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We introduce the notion of analytic primes and
prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are analytic primes. From
function Hilbert space perspective, we additionally prove that $M$-ideals in
$H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are dense in the Hardy space. We show that outer
functions play a key role in representing singly generated closed ideals in
$H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are $M$-ideals. This is also relevant to $M$-ideals
in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are finitely generated closed ideals in
$H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. We analyze $p$-sets of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ and their
connection to the \v{S}ilov boundary of the maximal ideal space of
$H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. Some of our results apply to the polydisc. In addition
to addressing questions regarding $M$-ideals, the results presented in this
paper offer some new perspectives on bounded analytic functions.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a comprehensive weighted theory for a class of
Banach-valued multilinear bounded oscillation operators on measure spaces,
which merges multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators with a quantity of
operators beyond the multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. We prove that
such multilinear operators and corresponding commutators are locally pointwise
dominated by two sparse dyadic operators, respectively. We also establish three
kinds of typical estimates: local exponential decay estimates, mixed weak type
estimates, and sharp weighted norm inequalities. Beyond that, based on Rubio de
Francia extrapolation for abstract multilinear compact operators, we obtain
weighted compactness for commutators of specific multilinear operators on
spaces of homogeneous type. A compact extrapolation allows us to get full range
of exponents, while weighted interpolation for multilinear compact operators is
crucial to the compact extrapolation. These are due to a weighted
Fr\'{e}chet-Kolmogorov theorem in the quasi-Banach range, which gives a
characterization of relative compactness of subsets in weighted Lebesgue
spaces. As applications, we illustrate multilinear bounded oscillation
operators with examples including multilinear Hardy-Littlewood maximal
operators on measure spaces, multilinear $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund
operators on spaces of homogeneous type, multilinear Littlewood-Paley square
operators, multilinear Fourier integral operators, higher order Calder\'{o}n
commutators, maximally modulated multilinear singular integrals, and
$q$-variation of $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators.

obtained on $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^d).$ In particular our $L^{\infty}$ and $L^1$

elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness
$h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depend on $h$.
We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is small relative to
the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model for a
poroelastic plate from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero using simultaneous
homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model
generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015
by dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that
it also covers the case of contact of poroelastic and elastic plate as well as
the evolution equation with inertia term.

smooth near zero and the time propagator has fast local time decay which is
very different from very short-range cases. The key element of the proof is to
establish a weaker Agmon estimate for a classically forbidden region using
exotic symbol calculus. As a byproduct, we prove that the Riesz operator is a

                                        <span>  Motivated by the refreezing of melt water in firn we revisit the
one-dimensional percolation of liquid water and non-reactive gas in porous ice.
We analyze the dynamics of infiltration in the absence of capillary forces and
heat conduction to understand the coupling between advective heat and mass
transport in firn. In this limit, we formulate a kinematic wave theory that
results in a 2X2-system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs)
corresponding to the conservation of composition and enthalpy. For simple
initial conditions (Riemann problems) this system admits self-similar solutions
that illuminate the structure of melting/refreezing fronts and analytical
solutions are provided for 12 basic cases of physical relevance encountered in
the literature. Further we develop an extended kinematic theory that
encompasses the cases when the firn saturates completely to form a perched
water table governed by elliptic PDE so that the model is no longer fully
hyperbolic (local). These solutions provide benchmarks for numerical models of
melt infiltration into firn. They also provide insight into important physical
processes such as the formation of frozen fringes, the perching of meltwater on
pre-existing low porosity layers and the conditions required for impermeable
ice lens formation. Lastly, these analytic solutions can be utilized to improve
and compare the performance of the firn hydrology, ice-sheet and Earth system
models. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to understand these
important processes in firn which affect the partitioning between meltwater
infiltration and surface runoff and therefore determine the surface mass loss
from ice sheets and its contribution to sea level rise.

total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modelling an
isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial
data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if
$m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must
be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with
spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find
the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space
and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case.
As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime
positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.

isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics
having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically
flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with
vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then
Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a
recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for
continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence,
any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has
nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and
the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower
bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large
scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.

Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete
variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered
another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional
advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and
illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also
derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time
mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the
space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as
against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.

                                        <span>  This work examines the controllability of planar incompressible ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Interior controls are obtained for problems posed
in doubly-connected regions; simply-connected configurations are driven by
boundary controls. Up to now, only straight channels regulated at opposing
walls have been studied. Hence, the present program adds to the literature an
exploration of interior controllability, extends the known boundary
controllability results, and contributes ideas for treating general domains. To
transship obstacles stemming from the MHD coupling and the magnetic field
topology, a divide-and-control strategy is proposed. This leads to a family of
nonlinear velocity-controlled sub-problems which are solved using J.-M. Coron's
return method. The latter is here developed based on a reference trajectory in
the domain's first cohomology space.

                                        <span>  We address the problem of the best uniform approximation of a continuous
function on a convex domain. The approximation is by linear combinations of a
finite system of functions (not necessarily Chebyshev) under arbitrary linear
constraints. By modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative
procedure we present a method, which demonstrates its efficiency in numerical
problems. The linear rate of convergence is proved under some favourable
assumptions. A special attention is paid to systems of complex exponents,
Gaussian functions, lacunar algebraic and trigonometric polynomials.
Applications to signal processing, linear ODE, switching dynamical systems, and
to Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are considered.

orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar
decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem
for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the
corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a
radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the
exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence,
we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge
to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal
phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by
Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization
operators.

thorough study of the $L^1$-operator algebra $\ell_0^1(G)$, the augmentation
ideal of $\ell^1(G)$ for a discrete group $G$, and then show that, at least
when $G=\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, its multiplier algebra is not an

                                        <span>  Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such
that $|f|=|g|$ on various sets $A$. We first prove that there exists $c$ in the
unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in
$\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$.
The same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and
$A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not.
We also provide sequential versions of the previous results and analyse the
case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally we examine the situation when there is equality on
two distinct circles in the disc, proving a result or counterexample for each
possible configuration.

                                        <span>  We consider a family of linear operators, diagonalized by the Hankel
transform. The Fredholm determinants of these operators, restricted to $L_2[0,
R]$, are expressed in a convenient form for asymptotic analysis as
$R\to\infty$. The result is an identity, in which the determinant is equal to
the leading asymptotic multiplied by an asymptotically small factor, for which
an explicit formula is derived. We apply the result to the determinantal point
process with the Bessel kernel, calculating the speed of the convergence of
additive functionals with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.

invertible, essentially left Drazin invertible, right Drazin invertible, and
essentially right Drazin invertible operators on Banach spaces, building upon
the groundwork laid in [8] and [19]. Specifically, we propose alternative
definitions for these operators and investigate their behavior in powers.
Furthermore, we employ a specific operator decomposition to characterize these
operators, providing a deeper understanding of their structure and properties.
The operators we study are distinguished from other operators bearing the same
name in existing literature, see [1], [9]. By employing more refined
definitions, we uncover a broader range of properties for these operators,
setting them apart from their counterparts in the literature.

                                        <span>  We establish homogenization for nondegenerate viscous Hamilton-Jacobi
equations in one space dimension when the diffusion coefficient $a(x,\omega) >
0$ and the Hamiltonian $H(p,x,\omega)$ are general stationary ergodic processes
in $x$. Our result is valid under mild regularity assumptions on $a$ and $H$
plus standard coercivity and growth assumptions (in $p$) on the latter. In
particular, we impose neither any additional condition on the law of the media
nor any shape restriction on the graph of $p\mapsto H(p,x,\omega)$. Our
approach consists of two main steps: (i) constructing a suitable candidate
$\overline{H}$ for the effective Hamiltonian; (ii) proving homogenization. In
the first step, we work with the set $E$ of all points at which $\overline{H}$
is naturally determined by correctors with stationary derivatives. We prove
that $E$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is unbounded from above and
below, and, if $E\neq\mathbb{R}$, then $\overline{H}$ can be extended
continuously to $\mathbb{R}$ by setting it to be constant on each connected
component of $E^c$. In the second step, we use a key bridging lemma, comparison
arguments and several general results to verify that homogenization holds with
this $\overline{H}$ as the effective Hamiltonian.

                                        <span>  We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional
channel. The tangential and normal velocities are assumed to be periodic in the
streamwise (horizontal) direction. Moreover, we consider no-slip boundary
conditions on the tangential velocity at the top and bottom walls of the
channel, and normal velocity actuation at the top and bottom walls. For an
arbitrarily large Reynolds number, we design the boundary control inputs to
achieve global exponential stabilization, in the L2 sense, of a chosen
parabolic Poiseuille profile. Moreover, we design the control inputs such that
they have zero mean, but non-zero cubic mean. The zero-mean property is to
ensure that the conservation of mass constraint is verified. The non-zero cubic
mean property is the key to exploiting the stabilizing effect of nonlinear
convection and achieving global stabilization independently of the size of the
Reynolds number. This paper is not only the first work where a closed-form
feedback law is proposed for global stabilization of parabolic Poiseuille
profiles for arbitrary Reynolds number but is also the first generalization of
the Cardano-Lyapunov formula, designed initially to stabilize scalar-valued
convective PDEs, to a vector-valued convective PDE with a divergence-free
constraint on the state.

                                        <span>  A mathematical model that governs turbulent flows through permeable media is
considered in this work. The model under consideration is based on a
double-averaging concept which in turn is described by the time-averaging
technique characteristic of the turbulence k-epsilon model and by the
volume-averaging methodology that is used to model unstable flows through
porous media. The functions of turbulence viscosity, turbulence diffusion and
turbulence production are assumed to be unbounded with respect to the turbulent
kinetic energy. For the associated initial-and boundary-value problem, we prove
the existence of suitable weak solutions.

Gennes equation in an appropriate semiclassical form and establish its
semiclassical limit to a two-particle kinetic transport equation with an
effective mean-field background potential satisfying the one-particle Vlasov
equation. Moreover, for some semiclassical regimes, we obtain a higher-order
correction to the two-particle kinetic transport equation, capturing a
nontrivial two-body interaction effect. The convergence is proven for $C^2$
interaction potentials in terms of a semiclassical optimal transport
pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of
Marcantoni et al. [arXiv:2310.15280], we establish a joint semiclassical and
mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a system of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Fermions by the Vlasov equation in some negative order Sobolev topology.

                                        <span>  The global existence and boundedness of solutions to quasi-linear
reaction-diffusion systems are investigated. The system arises from
compartmental models describing the spread of infectious diseases proposed in
[Viguerie et al, Appl. Math. Lett. (2021); Viguerie et al, Comput. Mech.
(2020)], where the diffusion rate is assumed to depend on the total population,
leading to quasilinear diffusion with possible degeneracy. The mathematical
analysis of this model has been addressed recently in [Auricchio et al, Math.
Method Appl. Sci. (2023] where it was essentially assumed that all
sub-populations diffuse at the same rate, which yields a positive lower bound
of the total population, thus removing the degeneracy. In this work, we remove
this assumption completely and show the global existence and boundedness of
solutions by exploiting a recently developed $L^p$-energy method. Our approach
is applicable to a larger class of systems and is sufficiently robust to allow
model variants and different boundary conditions.

incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations with phase transition, we derive
a necessary and sufficient condition for a dryout point to exist when the
temperature at the liquid-vapor interface is given. In addition, we show by
considering thermodynamics that the temperature at the dryout point and the
density of the vapor phase can be determined by given density and sufficiently
small injected mass flux of the liquid phase.

                                        <span>  We investigate the effective elastic properties of periodic dilute two-phase
composites consisting of an homogeneous isotropic matrix and a periodic array
of rigid inclusions. We assume the rigid inclusion in a unit cell is a simply
connected, bounded domain so that there exists an exterior conformal mapping
corresponding the inclusion. Recently, an analytical series solution method for
the elastic problem with a rigid inclusion was developed based on the layer
potential technique and the geometric function theory \cite{Mattei:2021:EAS}.
In this paper, by using the series solution method, we derive expression
formulas for the elastic moment tensors--the coefficients of the multipole
expansion associated with an elastic inclusion--of an inclusion of arbitrary
shape. These formulas for the elastic moment tensors lead us to analytic
asymptotic formulas for the effective parameters of the periodic elastic
composites with rigid inclusions in terms of the associated exterior conformal
mapping.

inclusion problem in a two-dimensional unbounded isotropic medium with a
cavity. Generalizing the work of Mattei and Lim \cite{Mattei:2021:EAS}, this
study develops an analytic series solution method for the elastic inclusion
problem to encompass a cavity problem. The central mathematical challenge
tackled in this research is to deal with the conormal derivative condition. By
using the complex-variable formulation for the conormal derivative, we
effectively deal with the boundary condition and derive an explicit series
solution for the plane elastostatic problem with a cavity of arbitrary shape
subject to arbitrary far-field loading. The solution is expressed as a series
expansion in terms of the given far-field loading and the exterior conformal
mapping associated with the cavity.

                                        <span>  We study the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a
smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with initial velocity $u_0$ square-integrable,
divergence-free and tangent to $\partial \Omega$. We supplement the equations
with the Navier friction boundary conditions $u \cdot n = 0$ and $[(2Su)n +
\alpha u]_{\rm tang} = 0$, where $n$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial
\Omega$, $Su = (Du + (Du)^t)/2$, $\alpha \in C^0(\partial\Omega)$ is the
boundary friction coefficient and $[\cdot]_{\rm tang}$ is the projection of its
argument onto the tangent space of $\partial \Omega$. We prove global existence
of a weak Leray-type solution to the resulting initial-boundary value problem
and exponential decay in energy norm of these solutions when friction is
positive. We also prove exponential decay if friction is non-negative and the
domain is not a solid of revolution. In addition, in the frictionless case
$\alpha = 0$, we prove convergence of the solution to a steady rigid rotation,
if the domain is a solid of revolution. We use the Galerkin method for
existence, Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities, with suitable adaptations to account
for the differential geometry of the boundary, and a global-in-time, integral
Gronwall-type inequality.

                                        <span>  In this paper we study consensus-based optimization (CBO), which is a
multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method that can globally
minimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions and is amenable to theoretical analysis.
Based on an experimentally supported intuition that, on average, CBO performs a
gradient descent of the squared Euclidean distance to the global minimizer, we
devise a novel technique for proving the convergence to the global minimizer in
mean-field law for a rich class of objective functions. The result unveils
internal mechanisms of CBO that are responsible for the success of the method.
In particular, we prove that CBO performs a convexification of a large class of
optimization problems as the number of optimizing agents goes to infinity.
Furthermore, we improve prior analyses by requiring mild assumptions about the
initialization of the method and by covering objectives that are merely locally
Lipschitz continuous. As a core component of this analysis, we establish a
quantitative nonasymptotic Laplace principle, which may be of independent
interest. From the result of CBO convergence in mean-field law, it becomes
apparent that the hardness of any global optimization problem is necessarily
encoded in the rate of the mean-field approximation, for which we provide a
novel probabilistic quantitative estimate. The combination of these results
allows to obtain probabilistic global convergence guarantees of the numerical
CBO method.

model that is motivated by interstitial hydrodynamics and tissue deformation
mechanics (poro-elasto-hydrodynamics) within an in-vitro solid tumor. The
classical mixture theory is adopted for mass and momentum balance equations for
a two-phase system. A main contribution of this study, we treat the
physiological transport parameter (i.e., hydraulic resistivity) as anisotropic
and heterogeneous, thus the governing system is strongly coupled and nonlinear.
We derived a weak formulation and then formulated the equivalent fixed-point
problem. This enabled us to use the Galerkin method, and the classical results
on monotone operators combined with the well-known Schauder and Banach fixed
point theorems to prove the existence and uniqueness results.

sufficient smooth data, which allows us to study the inviscid limit of
associated positive viscosity solutions in the case $\alpha = 1$, where an
explicit bound on the difference is given. On the other hand, in the case
$\alpha = 0$ the stability near a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a
constant (or equivalently bounded) magnetic field is also obtained in which
nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms of the velocity and electric fields, and the
$L^\infty$ norm of the magnetic field converge to zero as time goes to infinity
with an implicit rate. In this velocity damping case, the situation is
different both in case of the two and a half, and three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system, where an explicit rate of convergence in
infinite time is computed for both the velocity and magnetic fields in
nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms. Therefore, there is a gap between NSM and MHD in
terms of the norm convergence of the magnetic field and the rate of decaying in
time, even the latter equations can be proved as a limiting system of the
former one in the sense of distributions as the speed of light tends to
infinity.

approach to the study of rational approximations of holomorphic semigroups on
Banach spaces. We provide unified and simple proofs to a number of basic
results on semigroup approximations and substantially improve some of them. We
show that many of our estimates are essentially optimal, thus complementing the
existing literature.

Fourier series of integrable functions on the homogeneous space
$\mathbf{\Gamma}\backslash SE(d)$, where $SE(d)$ is the special Euclidean group
in dimension $d$, and $\mathbf{\mathbf{\Gamma}}$ is a discrete and co-compact
subgroup of $SE(d)$. Suppose that $\mu$ is the finite $SE(d)$-invariant measure
on the right coset space $\mathbf{\Gamma}\backslash SE(d)$, normalized with
respect to Weil's formula. The analytic aspects of the proposed method works
for any given orthonormal basis of the Hilbert function space
$L^2(\mathbf{\Gamma}\backslash SE(d),\mu)$. The paper is concluded with some
convolution and Plancherel formulas.

Abel-Lidskii basis property for a sectorial operator. Having studied such an
operator class, we strengthened the conditions regarding the semi-angle of the
sector and weakened a great deal conditions regarding the involved parameters.
Thus, we clarified the results by Lidskii V.B. devoted to the decomposition on
the root vector system of the non-selfadjoint operator. We used a technique of
the entire function theory and introduced the so-called Schatten-von Neumann
class of the convergence exponent. Having considered strictly accretive
operators satisfying special conditions formulated in terms of the norm and
used a sequence of contours of the power type, we invented a peculiar method
how to calculate a contour integral involved in the problem. Finally, we
consider evolution equations in the abstract Hilbert space.

semigroups generated by several (even infinitely many) automorphisms of the
unit disc is described. As part of this work, the near $S^*$-invariance
property of the image space $C_\varphi({\rm ker\, } T)$ is explored for
composition operators $C_\varphi$, induced by inner functions $\varphi$, and
Toeplitz operators $T$. After that, the analysis of nearly invariant subspaces
for strongly continuous multiplication semigroups of isometries is developed
with a study of cyclic subspaces generated by a single Hardy class function.
These are characterised in terms of model spaces in all cases when the outer
factor is a product of an invertible function and a rational (not necessarily
invertible) function. Techniques used include the theory of Toeplitz kernels
and reproducing kernels.

                                        <span>  This work is concerned with the high contrast stochastic homogenization of
the Helmholtz equation. Our goal is to characterize the second order moments of
the scaling limit of the fluctuations of the wavefield. We show that these
moments are those of a random wavefield solution to a homogenized Helmholtz
equation with a white noise source term and obtain expressions for its
variance. Two factors contribute to the white noise: fluctuations in the
inverse permittivity of the high contrast inhomogeneities, and fluctuations in
their size. This problem is motivated by wave propagation in sea ice, which is
a random compositive of ice and pockets of air and brine. The analysis hinges
on three ingredients: a covariance formula due to Chatterjee for functions of
independent random variables; small-volume expansions to quantify the
fluctuations due to one inclusion; and the standard two-scale expansions for
stochastic homogenization.

                                        <span>  The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with
power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a
low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in
appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are
restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one
previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value
problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary
problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in
Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require
estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value
problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces
for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified
Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead
of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the
standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value
problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an
additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain
Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz)
and non-compact boundary.

properties for the Schr\"odinger operator on a bounded domain in $\mathbb R^d$.
We extend Logunov, Malinnikova's results concerning propagation of smallness
for $A$-harmonic functions to solutions of divergence elliptic equations
perturbed by a bounded zero order term. We also prove similar results for
gradient of solutions to some particular equations. This latter result enables
us to follow the recent strategy of Burq, Moyano for the obtaining of spectral
estimates on rough sets for the Schr\"odinger operator. Applications to
observability estimates and to the null-controllability of associated parabolic
equations posed on compact manifolds or the whole euclidean space are then
considered.

                                        <span>  Inverse problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Many of these are
naturally formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. These
non-linear, large-scale, constrained optimization problems know many
challenges, of which the inherent non-linearity of the problem is an important
one. As an alternative to this physics-driven approach, data-driven methods
have been proposed. These methods come with their own set of challenges, and it
appears that, ideally, one would devise hybrid methods that combine the best of
both worlds. In this paper, we propose one way of combining PDE-constrained
optimization with recently proposed data-driven reduced-order models. Starting
from an infinite-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem with discrete
data, we propose a general framework for the analysis and discretisation of
such problems. The proposed approach is based on a relaxed formulation of the
PDE-constrained optimization problem, which reduces to a weighted non-linear
least-squares problem. The weight matrix turns out to be the Gram matrix of
solutions of the PDE, and it can be estimated directly from the measurements.
We provide a number of representative case studies and numerical examples.

                                        <span>  For linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCPs) governed by elliptic and
parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), we investigate the impact of
perturbations on optimal solutions. Local perturbations may occur, e.g., due to
discretization of the optimality system or disturbed problem data. Whereas
these perturbations may exhibit global effects in the uncontrolled case, we
prove that the ramifications are exponentially damped in space under
stabilizability- and detectability-like conditions. To this end, we prove a
bound on the optimality condition's solution operator that is uniform in the
domain size. Then, this uniformity is used in a scaling argument to show the
exponential decay of perturbations in space. We numerically validate and
illustrate our results by solving OCPs involving Helmholtz, Poisson, and
advection-diffusion-reaction equations.

stationary solutions of the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with
singular sensitivity and logistic source, \begin{cases} u_t=u_{xx}-\chi
(\frac{u}{v} v_x)_x+u(a-b u), & 0<x<L, \, t>0,\cr 0=v_{xx}- \mu v+ \nu u, &
0<x<L, \, t>0 \cr u_x(t,0)=u_x(t,L)=v_x(t,0)=v_x(t,L)=0, & t>0, \tag{1}
\end{cases} where $\chi$, $a$, $b$, $\mu$, $\nu$ are positive constants. Among
others, we prove there are $\chi^*>0$ and $\{\chi_k^*\}\subset [\chi^*,\infty)$
($\chi^*\in\{\chi_k^*\}$) such that the constant solution
$(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ of (1) is locally stable when
$0<\chi<\chi^*$ and is unstable when $\chi>\chi^*$, and under some generic
condition, for each $k\ge 1$, a (local) branch of non-constant stationary
solutions of (1) bifurcates from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$
when $\chi$ passes through $\chi_k^*$, and global extension of the local
bifurcation branch is obtained. We also prove that any sequence of non-constant
positive stationary solutions $\{(u(\cdot;\chi_n),v(\cdot;\chi_n))\}$ of (1)
with $\chi=\chi_n(\to \infty)$ develops spikes at any $x^*$ satisfying
$\liminf_{n\to\infty} u(x^*;\chi_n)>\frac{a}{b}$. Some numerical analysis is
carried out. It is observed numerically that the local bifurcation branch
bifurcating from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ when $\chi$ passes
through $\chi^*$ can be extended to $\chi=\infty$ and the stationary solutions
on this global bifurcation extension are locally stable when $\chi\gg 1$ and
develop spikes as $\chi\to\infty$.

                                        <span>  The purpose of this work is to provide a finite dimensional approximation of
the solution to a mean field optimal control problem set on the $d$-dimensional
torus. The approximation is obtained by means of a Fourier-Galerkin method, the
main principle of which is to convolve probability measures on the torus by the
Dirichlet kernel or, equivalently, to truncate the Fourier expansion of
probability measures on the torus. However, this operation has the main feature
not to leave the space of probability measures invariant, which drawback is
know as \textit{Gibbs}' phenomenon. In spite of this, we manage to prove that,
for initial conditions in the `interior' of the space of probability measures
and for sufficiently large levels of truncation, the Fourier-Galerkin method
induces a new finite dimensional control problem whose trajectories take values
in the space of probability measures with a finite number of Fourier
coefficients. Our main result asserts that, whenever the cost functionals are
smooth and convex, the distance between the optimal trajectories of the
original and approximating control problems decreases at a polynomial rate as
the index of truncation in the Fourier-Galerkin method tends to $\infty$. A
similar result holds for the distance between the corresponding value
functions. From a practical point of view, our approach provides an efficient
strategy to approximate mean field control optimizers by finite dimensional
parameters and opens new perspectives for the numerical analysis of mean field
control problems. It may be also applied to discretize more general mean field
game systems.

distributions of solutions to stochastic differential equations of
McKean-Vlasov type, are established by using a perturbation technique. These
representations are used to obtain exact random vortex dynamics for
wall-bounded viscous flows. Numerical schemes therefore are proposed and the
convergence of the numerical schemes for random vortex dynamics with an
additional force term is established. Several numerical experiments are carried
out for demonstrating the motion of a viscous flow within a thin layer next to

                                        <span>  We construct small amplitude gravity-capillary water waves with small nonzero
vorticity, in three spatial dimensions, bifurcating from uniform flows. The
waves are symmetric, and periodic in both horizontal coordinates. The proof is
inspired by Lortz' construction of magnetohydrostatic equilibria in
reflection-symmetric toroidal domains. It relies on a global representation of
the vorticity as the cross product of two gradients, and on prescribing a
functional relationship between the Bernoulli function and the orbital period
of the water particles. The presence of the free surface introduces significant
new challenges. In particular, the resulting free boundary problem is not
elliptic, and the involved maps incur a loss of regularity under Fr\'echet
differentiation. Nevertheless, we show that a version of the
Crandall--Rabinowitz local bifurcation method applies, by carefully tracking
the loss of regularity.

                                        <span>  We prove an explicit weighted estimate for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger
operator $P = - h^2 \partial^2_x + V(x;h)$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, with $V(x;h)$
a finite signed measure, and where $h >0$ is the semiclassical parameter. The
proof is a one dimensional instance of the spherical energy method, which has
been used to prove Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in more
complicated geometries. The novelty of our result is that the potential need
not be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Two consequences
of the weighted estimate are the absence of positive eigenvalues for $P$, and a
limiting absorption resolvent estimate with sharp $h$-dependence. The resolvent
estimate implies exponential time-decay of the local energy for solutions to
the corresponding wave equation with a compactly supported measure potential,
provided there are no negative eigenvalues and no zero resonance, and provided
the initial data have compact support.

                                        <span>  We consider finite element approximations of ill-posed elliptic problems with
conditional stability. The notion of {\emph{optimal error estimates}} is
defined including both convergence with respect to mesh parameter and
perturbations in data. The rate of convergence is determined by the conditional
stability of the underlying continuous problem and the polynomial order of the
finite element approximation space. A proof is given that no finite element
approximation can converge at a better rate than that given by the definition,
justifying the concept. A recently introduced class of finite element methods
with weakly consistent regularisation is recalled and the associated error
estimates are shown to be quasi optimal in the sense of our definition.

two different types of amphiphilic lipids. The model extends work by Peletier
and the second author [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 193, 2009] for the one-phase
case. We present a mathematical analysis of the asymptotic reduction to the
macroscale when a key length parameter becomes arbitrarily small. We identify
two main contributions in the energy: one that can be connected to bending of
the overall structure and a second that describes the cost of the internal
phase separations. We prove the $\Gamma$-convergence towards a perimeter
functional for the phase separation energy and construct, in two dimensions,
recovery sequences for the convergence of the full energy towards a 2D
reduction of the J\"ulicher-Lipowsky bending energy with a line tension
contribution for phase separated hypersurfaces.

                                        <span>  We consider heat operators on a bounded domain $\Omega \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^n$, with a critically singular potential diverging as the inverse
square of the distance to $\partial \Omega$. While null boundary
controllability for such operators was recently proved in all dimensions in
arXiv:2112.04457, it crucially assumed (i) $\Omega$ was convex, (ii) the
control must be prescribed along all of $\partial \Omega$, and (iii) the
strength of the singular potential must be restricted to a particular subrange.
In this article, we prove instead a definitive approximate boundary control
result for these operators, in that we (i) do not assume convexity of $\Omega$,
(ii) allow for the control to be localized near any $x_0 \in \partial \Omega$,
and (iii) treat the full range of strength parameters for the singular
potential. Morever, we lower the regularity required for $\partial \Omega$ and
the lower-order coefficients. The key novelty is a local Carleman estimate near
$x_0$, with a carefully chosen weight that takes into account both the
appropriate boundary conditions and the local geometry of $\partial \Omega$.

                                        <span>  The Gray-Scott model is a set of reaction-diffusion equations that describes
chemical systems far from equilibrium. Interest in this model stems from its
ability to generate spatio-temporal structures, including pulses, spots,
stripes, and self-replicating patterns. We consider an extension of this model
in which the spread of the different chemicals is assumed to be nonlocal, and
can thus be represented by an integral operator. In particular, we focus on the
case of strictly positive, symmetric, $L^1$ convolution kernels that have a
finite second moment. Modeling the equations on a finite interval, we prove the
existence of small-time weak solutions in the case of nonlocal Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary constraints. We then use this result to develop a finite
element numerical scheme that helps us explore the effects of nonlocal
diffusion on the formation of pulse solutions.

                                        <span>  We consider a structural stochastic volatility model for the loss from a
large portfolio of credit risky assets. Both the asset value and the volatility
processes are correlated through systemic Brownian motions, with default
determined by the asset value reaching a lower boundary. We prove that if our
volatility models are picked from a class of mean-reverting diffusions, the
system converges as the portfolio becomes large and, when the vol-of-vol
function satisfies certain regularity and boundedness conditions, the limit of
the empirical measure process has a density given in terms of a solution to a
stochastic initial-boundary value problem on a half-space. The problem is
defined in a special weighted Sobolev space. Regularity results are established
for solutions to this problem, and then we show that there exists a unique
solution. In contrast to the CIR volatility setting covered by the existing
literature, our results hold even when the systemic Brownian motions are taken
to be correlated.

                                        <span>  We consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation $\partial_t u =
-\partial_x(\partial_x^2 u + f(u))$, where $f(u)$ is an odd function of class
$C^3$. Under some assumptions on $f$, this equation admits \emph{solitary
waves}, that is solutions of the form $u(t, x) = Q_v(x - vt - x_0)$, for $v$ in
some range $(0, v_*)$. We study pure two-solitons in the case of the same limit
speed, in other words global solutions $u(t)$ such that \begin{equation}
\label{eq:abstract} \tag{$\ast$} \lim_{t\to\infty}\|u(t) - (Q_v(\cdot - x_1(t))
\pm Q_v(\cdot - x_2(t)))\|_{H^1} = 0, \qquad \text{with}\quad\lim_{t \to

known for $f(u) = |u|^{p-1}u$ with $p \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{5\}$ and $p >
2$. We describe the~dynamical behavior of any solution satisfying
\eqref{eq:abstract} under the assumption that $Q_v$ is linearly unstable (which
corresponds to $p > 5$ for power nonlinearities). We prove that in this case
the sign in \eqref{eq:abstract} is necessarily "$+$", which corresponds to an
attractive interaction. We also prove that the~distance $x_2(t) - x_1(t)$
between the solitons equals $\frac{2}{\sqrt v}\log(\kappa t) + o(1)$ for some
$\kappa = \kappa(v) > 0$.

results by using them to obtain rates of energy decay in coupled systems of
one-dimensional wave and heat equations, and in a wave equation with an

minimization of the Willmore functional in the class of oriented closed
surfaces with prescribed total mean curvature, prescribed area, and prescribed
genus. Adapting methods previously developed by Keller-Mondino-Rivi\`ere,
Bauer-Kuwert, and Ndiaye-Sch\"atzle, we prove existence of smooth minimizers
for a large class of constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic behaviour
of the energy profile close to the unit sphere and consider the total mean
curvature of axisymmetric surfaces.

                                        <span>  The half-wave maps equation is a nonlocal geometric equation arising in the
continuum dynamics of Haldane-Shashtry and Calogero-Moser spin systems. In high
dimensions $n\geq4$, global wellposedness for data which is small in the
critical Besov space $\dot{B}^{n/2}_{2,1}$ is known since the works of Krieger,
Sire and Kiesenhofer [13,9]. There is a major obstruction in extending these
results to three dimensions due to the loss of the crucial $L^2_tL^\infty_x$
Strichartz estimate. In this work, we make progress on this case by proving
that the equation is "weakly" globally well-posed (in the sense of Tao [28])
for initial data which is not only small in $\dot{B}^{3/2}_{2,1}$ but also
possesses some angular regularity and weighted decay of derivatives. We use
Sterbenz's improved Strichartz estimates in conjunction with certain commuting
vector fields to develop trilinear estimates in weighted Strichartz spaces
which avoid the use of the $L^2_tL^\infty_x$ endpoint.

                                        <span>  At higher altitudes, for high temperature gases, for instance near space
shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are
affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such
hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of
dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a
mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical
reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of
associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous
internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a
Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the
linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend
some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the
introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that
the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive
multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral
operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The
strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least)
uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact
operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct
consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision
frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with
cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of
the linearized collision operator are obtained

                                        <span>  In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in
kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent
system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as
self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social
network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which
modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We
then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its
large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for
the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and
is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the
graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing
the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon
structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the
effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering
the system towards a declustered state.

spaces defined on the unit square via B-spline quarklets. For that purpose in a
first step we use univariate boundary adapted quarklets to describe univariate
Bessel-Potential spaces on intervals. To obtain the bivariate characterizations
a recent result of Hansen and Sickel is applied. It yields that each bivariate
Bessel-Potential space on a square can be written as an intersection of
function spaces which have a tensor product structure. Hence our main result is
a characterization of bivariate Bessel-Potential spaces on squares in terms of
quarklets that are tensor products of univariate quarklets on intervals.

the data in classical spaces for the initial-boundary-value problem of the
diffusion equation on the half-line, with data that are not necessarily
compatible at the quadrant corner. This is based on a recent approach to
rigorously analyzing integral representations derived via the unified transform
method of Fokas. No exotic phenomena were discovered in this case, yet our
findings appear to be new in the pertinent literature. These results supplement
our previous investigations on existence and (non)uniqueness within the
framework of well-posedness. The present detailed exposition elucidates the
subtleties involved while also demonstrating a generic technique. Applications
of the latter to several other IBVPs and PDEs will be reported elsewhere.

Human-driven Vehicles (HV) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) have gained increasing
attention. This paper is focused on suppressing traffic oscillations of the
mixed-autonomy traffic system using boundary control design. The mixed traffic
dynamics are described by a 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations
(PDE) which governs propagation of four properties in traffic including density
of HV, density of AV, friction between two classes of vehicles from driving
interactions, and averaged velocity. We propose event-triggered boundary
control design since control signal of traffic light on ramp or varying speed
limit cannot be updated in a continuous time fashion. We apply event-triggered
mechanism for a PDE backstepping controller and obtain dynamic triggering
condition. Lyapunov analysis is conducted to prove the exponential stability of
the closed loop system with the event-triggered controller. Numerical
simulation demonstrates how car-following spacing of AV affects
event-triggering mechanism of control input in mixed-autonomy traffic.

media equation and the Stokes transport system in a periodic channel. It is
well-known that a stratified density, which strictly decreases in the vertical
direction, is asymptotically stable under sufficiently small and smooth
perturbations. We provide improvements in the regularity assumptions on the
perturbation and in the convergence rate. Unlike the standard approach for
stability analysis relying on linearized equations, we directly address the
nonlinear problem by exploiting the energy structure of each system. While it
is widely known that the potential energy is a Lyapunov functional in both
systems, our key observation is that the second derivative of the potential
energy reveals a (degenerate) coercive structure, which arises from the fact
that the solution converges to the minimizer of the energy.

                                        <span>  For nonlinear Cosserat elasticity, we consider multiscale methods in this
paper. In particular, we explore the generalized multiscale finite element
method (GMsFEM) to solve an isotropic Cosserat problem with strain-limiting
property (ensuring bounded linearized strains even under high stresses). Such
strain-limiting Cosserat model can find potential applications in solids and
biological fibers. However, Cosserat media with naturally rotational degrees of
freedom, nonlinear constitutive relations, high contrast, and heterogeneities
may produce challenging multiscale characteristics in the solution, and
upscaling by multiscale methods is necessary. Therefore, we utilize the offline
and residual-based online (adaptive or uniform) GMsFEM in this context while
handling the nonlinearity by Picard iteration. Through various two-dimensional
experiments (for perforated, composite, and stochastically heterogeneous media
with small and big strain-limiting parameters), our numerical results show the
approaches' convergence, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, these results
demonstrate that such approaches provide good accuracy, the online GMsFEM gives
more accurate solutions than the offline one, and the online adaptive strategy
has similar accuracy to the uniform one but with fewer degrees of freedom.

the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove
emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous
error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the
approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we
identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves
semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of
the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are
much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to
a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.

                                        <span>  We develop a convex integration scheme for constructing nonunique weak
solutions to the hydrostatic Euler equations (also known as the inviscid
primitive equations of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics) in both two and three
dimensions. We also develop such a scheme for the construction of nonunique
weak solutions to the three-dimensional viscous primitive equations, as well as
the two-dimensional Prandtl equations.
  While in [D.W. Boutros, S. Markfelder and E.S. Titi, Calc. Var. Partial
Differential Equations, 62 (2023), 219] the classical notion of weak solution
to the hydrostatic Euler equations was generalised, we introduce here a further
generalisation. For such generalised weak solutions we show the existence and
nonuniqueness for a large class of initial data. Moreover, we construct
infinitely many examples of generalised weak solutions which do not conserve
energy. The barotropic and baroclinic modes of solutions to the hydrostatic
Euler equations (which are the average and the fluctuation of the horizontal
velocity in the $z$-coordinate, respectively) that are constructed have
different regularities.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we prove the uniqueness of ground states to the following
fractional nonlinear elliptic equation with harmonic potential, $$ (-\Delta)^s
u+ \left(\omega+|x|^2\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in}\,\, \R^n, $$ where $n
\geq 1$, $0<s<1$, $\omega>-\lambda_{1,s}$, $2<p<\frac{2n}{(n-2s)^+}$,
$\lambda_{1,s}>0$ is the lowest eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s + |x|^2$. The
fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ is characterized as
$\mathcal{F}((-\Delta)^{s}u)(\xi)=|\xi|^{2s} \mathcal{F}(u)(\xi)$ for $\xi \in
\R^n$, where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the Fourier transform. This solves an open
question in \cite{SS} concerning the uniqueness of ground states.

                                        <span>  We study the asymptotic stability of the traveling front solutions to
nonlinear dispersive equations of Burgers type. Our main example is the
Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdVB) equation although the result holds much more
generally. Exploiting a modulation of the translation parameter and making an
energy estimate we establish our stability criterion that a Schr\"odinger
equation in one dimension have exactly one negative eigenvalue so that a
rank-one perturbation of the operator can be made positive semi-definite.
Counting the number of bound states of the Schr\"odinger equation in one
dimension, we find a sufficient condition for stability in terms of Bargmann's
integral, which can be interpreted as the distance between the monotonization
of the front and a corresponding ideal shock. For the KdVB equation we
analytically verify that our stability criterion is met in an open interval of
the relative dispersion parameter which includes all monotone fronts. Numerical
experiments suggest stability for a larger interval.

                                        <span>  In this manuscript we derive a new nonlinear transport equation written on
the space of probability measures that allows to study a class of deterministic
mean field games and master equations, where the interaction of the agents
happens only at the terminal time. The point of view via this transport
equation has two important consequences. First, this equation reveals a new
monotonicity condition that is sufficient both for the uniqueness of MFG Nash
equilibria and for the global in time well-posedness of master equations.
Interestingly, this condition is in general in dichotomy with both the
Lasry--Lions and displacement monotonicity conditions, studied so far in the
literature. Second, in the absence of monotonicity, the conservative form of
the transport equation can be used to define weak entropy solutions to the
master equation. We construct several concrete examples to demonstrate that MFG
Nash equilibria, whether or not they actually exist, may not be selected by the
entropy solutions of the master equation.

                                        <span>  We study the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS)
equation under the assumption that the solution vanishes as $x \to + \infty$
and approaches an oscillatory plane wave as $x \to -\infty$. We first develop
an inverse scattering transform formalism for solutions satisfying such
step-like boundary conditions. Using this formalism, we prove that there exists
a global solution of the corresponding Cauchy problem and establish a
representation for this solution in terms of the solution of a Riemann-Hilbert
problem. By performing a steepest descent analysis of this Riemann-Hilbert
problem, we identify three asymptotic sectors in the half-plane $t \geq 0$ of
the $xt$-plane and derive asymptotic formulas for the solution in each of these
sectors. Finally, by restricting the constructed solutions to the half-line $x
\geq 0$, we find a class of solutions with asymptotically time-periodic
boundary values previously sought for in the context of the NLS half-line
problem.

ball $B_p^n$ perpendicular to a^(n) = 1/sqrt(n) (1, ... ,1) for large $n$ has
larger volume than the one orthogonal to a^(2) = 1/sqrt(2) (1,1,0, ...,0), as
shown by Oleszkiewicz. This is different from the case of $l_\infty^n$
considered by Ball. We give a quantitative estimate for which dimensions $n$
this happens, namely for $n > c (\frac 1 {p_0-p} + \frac 1 {p-2})$ for some
absolute constant $c>0$. Correspondingly for projections of $B_q^n$ onto
hyperplanes, Barthe and Naor showed that projections onto hyperplanes
perpendicular to $a^{(n)}$ have smaller volume for large $n$ than onto the one
orthogonal to $a^{(2)}$, if $\frac 4 3 < q < 2$, different from the case $q=1$.
We show that this happens for all $n > 5 (\frac 1 {q-\frac 4 3} + \frac 1
{2-q})$.

spaces defined on the unit square via B-spline quarklets. For that purpose in a
first step we use univariate boundary adapted quarklets to describe univariate
Bessel-Potential spaces on intervals. To obtain the bivariate characterizations
a recent result of Hansen and Sickel is applied. It yields that each bivariate
Bessel-Potential space on a square can be written as an intersection of
function spaces which have a tensor product structure. Hence our main result is
a characterization of bivariate Bessel-Potential spaces on squares in terms of
quarklets that are tensor products of univariate quarklets on intervals.

(2013) by M. Jim\'enez-Sevilla and L. S\'anchez-Gonz\'alez which generalise
(the basic statement of) the classical Whitney extension theorem for
$C^1$-smooth real functions on $\mathbb R^n$ to the case of real functions on
$X$ (\cite{JS1}) and to the case of mappings from $X$ to $Y$ (\cite{JS2}) for
some Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$. Since the proof from \cite{JS2} contains a
serious flaw, we supply a different more transparent detailed proof under
(probably) slightly stronger assumptions on $X$ and $Y$. Our proof gives also
extensions results from special sets (e.g. Lipschitz submanifolds or closed
convex bodies) under substantially weaker assumptions on $X$ and $Y$. Further,
we observe that the mapping $F\in C^1(X;Y)$ which extends $f$ given on a closed
set $A\subset X$ can be, in some cases, $C^\infty$-smooth (or $C^k$-smooth with
$k>1$) on $X\setminus A$. Of course, also this improved result is weaker than
Whitney's result (for $X=\mathbb R^n$, $Y=\mathbb R$) which asserts that $F$ is
even analytic on $X\setminus A$. Further, following another Whitney's article
and using the above results, we prove results on extensions of $C^1$-smooth
mappings from open (``weakly'') quasiconvex subsets of $X$. Following the above
mentioned articles we also consider the question concerning the Lipschitz
constant of $F$ is $f$ is a Lipschitz mapping. We also present a new
observation on the limitation of the possible validity of Whitney's extension
theorem for $C^2$-smooth functions.

                                        <span>  The (Local) Lifting Property ((L)LP) is introduced by Kirchberg and deals
with lifting completely positive maps. We give a characterization of the (L)LP
in terms of lifting $\ast$-homomorphisms. We use it to prove that if $A$ and
$B$ have the LP and $F$ is their finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra, then
$A\ast_F B$ has the LP. This answers a question of Ozawa.
  We prove that Exel's soft tori have the LP. As a consequence we obtain that
$C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ is inductive limit of RFD C*-algebras with the LP.
  We prove that for a class of C*-algebras including $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ and
all contractible C*-algebras, the LLP is equivalent to Ext being a group.
  As byproduct of methods developed in the paper we generalize Kirchberg's
theorem about extensions with the WEP, give short proofs of several, old and
new, facts about soft tori, new unified proofs of Li and Shen's
characterization of RFD property of free products amalgamated over a
finite-dimensional subalgebra and Blackadar's characterization of
semiprojectivity of them.

                                        <span>  It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan
that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda =
\lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C
\lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on
manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however,
only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the
present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a
generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to
the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

growth is considered. The energy functional takes into account surface energy,
elastic misfit-energy and nucleation energy of dislocations. A scaling law for
the infimal energy is proven. The results quantify the expectation that in
certain parameter regimes, island formation or topological defects are
favorable. This generalizes results in the purely elastic setting from [Goldman

of a ball-construction combined with thorough local estimates is presented.

Combining fixed point arguments with suitable barrier functions, we construct

                                        <span>  We consider the long-time behavior of irrotational solutions of the
three-dimensional compressible Euler equations with shocks, hypersurfaces of
discontinuity across which the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for irrotational
flow hold. Our analysis is motivated by Landau's analysis of
spherically-symmetric shock waves, who predicted that at large times, not just
one, but two shocks emerge. These shocks are logarithmically-separated from the
Minkowskian light cone and the fluid velocity decays at the non-time-integrable
rate 1/(t(\log t)^{1/2}). We show that for initial data, which need not be
spherically-symmetric, with two shocks in it and which is sufficiently close,
in appropriately weighted Sobolev norms, to an N-wave profile, the solution to
the shock-front initial value problem can be continued for all time and does
not develop any further singularities. In particular this is the first proof of
global existence for solutions (which are necessarily singular) of a
quasilinear wave equation in three space dimensions which does not verify the
null condition. The proof requires carefully-constructed multiplier estimates
and analysis of the geometry of the shock surfaces.

                                        <span>  We consider a nonlinear model equation, known as the Localized Induction
Equation, describing the motion of a vortex filament immersed in an
incompressible and inviscid fluid. We show stability estimates for an
arc-shaped vortex filament, which is an exact solution to an initial-boundary
value problem for the Localized Induction Equation. An arc-shaped filament
travels along an axis at a constant speed without changing its shape, and is
oriented in such a way that the arc stays in a plane that is perpendicular to
the axis. We prove that an arc-shaped filament is stable in the Lyapunov sense
for general perturbations except in the axis-direction, for which the
perturbation can grow linearly in time. We also show that this estimate is
optimal. We then apply the obtained stability estimates to study the stability
of a circular vortex filament under some symmetry assumptions on the initial
perturbation. We do this by dividing the circular filament into arcs, apply the
stability estimate to each arc-shaped filament, and combine the estimates to
obtain estimates for the whole circle. The optimality of the stability
estimates for an arc-shaped filament also shows that a circular filament is not
stable in the Lyapunov sense, namely, certain perturbations can grow linearly
in time.

extended to arbitrary additive functors. The new defect and the contravariant
Yoneda embedding form a right adjoint pair. The main result identifies the
defect of the covariant Hom modulo projectives with the Bass torsion of the
fixed argument. When applied to a linear control systems, it shows that the
defect of the Malgrange functor of the system modulo projectives is isomorphic
to the autonomy of the system. Furthermore, the defect of the contravariant Hom
modulo injectives is shown to be isomorphic to the cotorsion coradical of the
fixed argument. Since the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen transform of cotorsion is
isomorphic to torsion, the above results raise two important questions: a) what
is a control-theoretic interpretation of the covariant Yoneda embedding of the
Malgrange module modulo injectives, and b) what is a control-theoretic
interpretation of the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen duality?

a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral
operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general
assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined,
once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz-Weyl
decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian
potential is an $L^p$ vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a
rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND.
Given that the Mondian potential satisfies a second-order partial differential
equation, the question arises whether it has second-order derivatives. We
affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry,
although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second
derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general
regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we
explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain
of QUMOND, thereby underlining their potential significance and applicability.

\textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria can trigger stochastically a stress response
known as the SOS response. While the expression of this stress response can
make individual cells transiently able to overcome antibiotic treatment, it can
also delay cell division, thus impacting the whole population's ability to grow
and survive. In order to study the trade-offs that emerge from this phenomenon,
we propose a bi-type age-structured population model that captures the
phenotypic plasticity observed in the stress response. Individuals can belong
to two types: either a fast-dividing but prone to death ``vulnerable'' type, or
a slow-dividing but ``tolerant'' type. We study the survival probability of the
population issued from a single cell as well as the population growth rate in
constant and periodic environments. We show that the sensitivity of these two
different notions of fitness with respect to the parameters describing the
phenotypic plasticity differs between the stochastic approach (survival
probability) and the deterministic approach (population growth rate). Moreover,
under a more realistic configuration of periodic stress, our results indicate
that optimal population growth can only be achieved through fine-tuning
simultaneously both the induction of the stress response and the repair

indirect signal production and phenotype switching is shown in a
two-dimensional setting when the switching rate increases to infinity, thereby
providing a rigorous justification of formal computations performed in the
literature. The expected limit system being the classical parabolic-parabolic
Keller-Segel system, the obtained convergence is restricted to a finite time
interval for general initial conditions but valid for arbitrary bounded time
intervals when the mass of the initial condition is appropriately small.
Furthermore, if the solution to the limit system blows up in finite time, then
neither of the two phenotypes in the partially diffusive system can be
uniformly bounded with respect to the $L_2$-norm beyond that time.

                                        <span>  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the development of abnormal cells
on the surface of the cervix, caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Although in most of the cases it is resolved by the immune system, a small
percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated,
can develop into cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common
cancer in women globally, for which the World Health Organization (WHO)
recently adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination by 2030.
With this research topic being more imperative than ever, in this paper, we
develop a nonlinear mathematical model describing the CIN progression. The
model consists of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of
epithelial, dysplastic and immune cells, as well as the dynamics of viral
particles. We use our model to explore numerically three important factors of
dysplasia progression, namely the geometry of the cervix, the strength of the
immune response and the frequency of viral exposure.

                                        <span>  We present stability estimates for the inverse source problem of the
stochastic Helmholtz equation in two and three dimensions by either near-field
or far-field data. The random source is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic
generalized Gaussian random function. For the direct problem, by exploring the
regularity of the Green function, we demonstrate that the direct problem admits
a unique bounded solution with an explicit integral representation, which
enhances the existing regularity result. For the case using near-field data,
the analysis of the inverse problem employs microlocal analysis to achieve an
estimate for the Fourier transform of the micro-correlation strength by the
near-field correlation data and a high-frequency tail. The stability follows by
showing the analyticity of the data and applying a novel analytic continuation
principle. The stability estimate by far-field data is derived by investigating
the correlation of the far-field data. The stability estimate consists of the
Lipschitz type data discrepancy and the logarithmic stability. The latter
decreases as the upper bound of the frequency increases, which exhibits the
phenomenon of increasing stability.

corresponds to a fourth order strictly parabolic scalar equation in the

                                        <span>  The research explores a high irregularity, commonly referred to as
intermittency, of the solution to the non-stationary parabolic Anderson
problem: \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \varkappa \mathcal{L}u(t,x) +
\xi_{t}(x)u(t,x) \end{equation*} with the initial condition \(u(0,x) \equiv
1\), where \((t,x) \in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{Z}^d\). Here, \(\varkappa
\mathcal{L}\) denotes a non-local Laplacian, and \(\xi_{t}(x)\) is a correlated
white noise potential. The observed irregularity is intricately linked to the
upper part of the spectrum of the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger equations for
the moment functions \(m_p(t,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_p) = \langle
u(t,x_1)u(t,x_2)\cdots u(t,x_p)\rangle\).
  In the first half of the paper, a weak form of intermittency is expressed
through moment functions of order $p\geq 3$ and established for a wide class of
operators $\varkappa \mathcal{L}$ with a positive-definite correlator $B=B(x))$
of the white noise. In the second half of the paper, the strong intermittency
is studied. It relates to the existence of a positive eigenvalue for the
lattice Schr\"odinger type operator with the potential $B$. This operator is
associated with the second moment $m_2$. Now $B$ is not necessarily
positive-definite, but $\sum B(x)\geq 0$.

a linear connection $\nabla$ on it (not necessarily a metric one), we prove the
$L^p$-boundedness of operators belonging to the global pseudo-differential
classes $\Psi_{\rho, \delta}^m\left(\Omega^\kappa, \nabla, \tau\right)$
constructed by Safarov. Our result recovers classical Fefferman's theorem, and
extends it to the following two situations: $\rho>1/3$ and $\nabla$ symmetric;
and $\nabla$ flat with any values of $\rho$ and $\delta$. Moreover, as a
consequence of our main result, we obtain boundedness on Sobolev and Besov
spaces and some $L^p-L^q$ boundedness. Different examples and applications are
presented.

system of two coupled linear Schr\"odinger equations in the one-dimensional
case where the state components are interacting through the Kirchhoff boundary
conditions. Considering the system in a bounded domain, the null boundary
controllability result is shown. The result is achieved thanks to a new
Carleman estimate, which ensures a boundary observation. Additionally, this
boundary observation together with some trace estimates, helps us to use the
Gramian approach, with a suitable choice of feedback law, to prove that the
system under consideration decays exponentially to zero at least as fast as the
function $e^{-2\omega t}$ for some $\omega>0$.

                                        <span>  We study the long time Schr\"odinger evolution of Lagrangian states $f_h$ on
a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ of negative sectional curvature. We
consider two models of semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators
$P_h^\alpha=-h^2\Delta_g +h^\alpha Q_\omega$, $0<\alpha\leq 1$, where the
semiclassical Laplace-Beltrami operator $-h^2\Delta_g$ on $X$ is subject to a
small random perturbation $h^\alpha Q_\omega$ given by either a random
potential or a random pseudo-differential operator. Here, the potential or the
symbol of $Q_\omega$ is bounded, but oscillates and decorrelates at scale
$h^{\beta}$, $0< \beta < \frac{1}{2}$. We prove a quantitative result that,
under appropriate conditions on $\alpha,\beta$, in probability with respect to
$\omega$ the long time propagation $$\mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{h}t_h P_h^\alpha }
f_h, \quad o(|\log h|)=t_h\to\infty, ~~h\to 0,$$ rescaled to the local scale of
$h$ around a uniformly at random chosen point $x_0$ on $X$, converges in law to
an isotropic stationary monochromatic Gaussian field -- the Berry Gaussian
field. We also provide and $\omega$-almost sure version of this convergence
along sufficiently fast decaying subsequences $h_j\to 0$.

                                        <span>  When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can
produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the
conventional Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several
modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge
density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB
equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter $\Lambda$, which not
only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have
oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric
effects and chemical potentials. As $\Lambda=0$, the PB-steric equation becomes
the conventional PB equation, but as $\Lambda>0$, the concentrations of ions
and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach
the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations
with the Robin boundary condition as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity. Our
theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for
$0\leq\Lambda\leq\infty$) may include the conventional and modified PB
equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find
oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the
conventional and modified PB equations.

                                        <span>  We prove that the functional volume product for even functions is monotone
increasing along the Fokker--Planck heat flow. This in particular yields a new
proof of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality by K. Ball and also
Artstein-Avidan--Klartag--Milman in the even case.
  This result is the consequence of a new understanding of the regularizing
property of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. That is, we establish an
improvement of Borell's reverse hypercontractivity inequality for even
functions and identify the sharp range of the admissible exponents. As another
consequence of successfully identifying the sharp range for the inequality, we
derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ inequality for the Laplace transform for even
functions. The best constant of the inequality is attained by centered
Gaussians, and thus this provides an analogous result to Beckner's sharp
Hausdorff--Young inequality.
  Our technical novelty in the proof is the use of the Brascamp--Lieb
inequality for log-concave measures and Cram\'{e}r--Rao's inequality in this
context.

                                        <span>  On the two-sphere $\Sigma$, we consider the problem of minimising among
suitable immersions $f \,\colon \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ the weighted
$L^\infty$ norm of the mean curvature $H$, with weighting given by a prescribed
ambient function $\xi$, subject to a fixed surface area constraint. We show
that, under a low-energy assumption which prevents topological issues from
arising, solutions of this problem and also a more general set of
``pseudo-minimiser'' surfaces must satisfy a second-order PDE system obtained
as the limit as $p \rightarrow \infty$ of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the
approximating $L^p$ problems. This system gives some information about the
geometric behaviour of the surfaces, and in particular implies that their mean
curvature takes on at most three values: $H \in \{ \pm \vert \vert \xi H \vert
\vert_{L^\infty} \}$ away from the nodal set of the PDE system, and $H = 0$ on
the nodal set (if it is non-empty).

                                        <span>  In the present study, Kolmogorov flow represents the stationary sinusoidal
solution $(\sin y,0)$ to a two-dimensional spatially periodic Navier-Stokes
system, driven by an external force. This system admits the additional
non-stationary solution $(\sin y,0)+e^{-\nu t} (\sin y,0)$, which tends
exponentially to the Kolmogorov flow at the minimum decay rate determined by
the viscosity $\nu$. Enhanced damping or enhanced dissipation of the problem is
obtained by presenting higher decay rate for the difference between a solution
and the non-stationary basic solution. Moreover, for the understanding of the
metastability problem in an explicit manner, a variety of exact solutions are
presented to show enhanced and unenhanced dampings.

                                        <span>  We consider a Laplace type problem with a generalized impedance boundary
condition of the form $\partial_\nu u=-\partial_x(g\partial_xu)$ on a flat part
$\Gamma$ of the boundary. Here $\nu$ is the outward unit normal vector to
$\partial\Omega$, $g$ is the impedance function and $x$ is the coordinate along
$\Gamma$. Such problems appear for example in the modelling of small
perturbations of the boundary. In the literature, the cases $g=1$ or $g=-1$
have been investigated. In this work, we address situations where $\Gamma$
contains the origin and $g(x)=\mathbb{1}_{x>0}(x)x^\alpha$ or
$g(x)=-\mbox{sign}(x)|x|^\alpha$ with $\alpha\ge0$. In other words, we study
cases where $g$ vanishes at the origin and changes its sign. The main message
is that the well-posedness in the Fredholm sense of the corresponding problems
depends on the value of $\alpha$. For $\alpha\in[0,1)$, we show that the
associated operators are Fredholm of index zero while it is not the case when
$\alpha=1$. The proof of the first results is based on the reformulation as 1D
problems combined with the derivation of compact embedding results for the
functional spaces involved in the analysis. The proof of the second results
relies on the computation of singularities and the construction of Weyl's
sequences. We also discuss the equivalence between the strong and weak
formulations, which is not straightforward. Finally, we provide simple
numerical experiments which seem to corroborate the theorems.

admits exact self-similar finite-time blowup solutions with interiorly smooth
profiles for all $a\leq 1$. Depending on the value of $a$, these self-similar
profiles are either smooth on the whole real line or compactly supported and
smooth in the interior of their closed supports. The existence of these
profiles is proved in a consistent way by considering the fixed-point problem
of an $a$-dependent nonlinear map, based on which detailed characterizations of
their regularity, monotonicity, and far-field decay rates are established. Our
work unifies existing results for some discrete values of $a$ and also explains
previous numerical observations for a wide range of $a$.

                                        <span>  We study a class of interacting particle systems in which $n$ signed
particles move on the real line. At close range particles with the same sign
repel and particles with opposite sign attract each other. The repulsion and
attraction are described by the same singular interaction force $f$. Particles
of opposite sign may collide in finite time. Upon collision, pairs of colliding
particles are removed from the system.
  In a recent paper by Peletier, Po\v{z}\'ar and the author, one particular
particle system of this type was studied; that in which $f(x) = \frac1x$ is the
Coulomb force. Global well-posedness of this particle system was shown and a
discrete-to-continuum limit (i.e. $n \to \infty$) to a nonlocal PDE for the
signed particle density was established. Both results rely on innovative use of
techniques in ODE theory and viscosity solutions.
  In the present paper we extend these results to a large class of particle
systems in order to cover many new applications. Motivated by these
applications, we consider the presence of an external force $g$, consider
interaction forces $f$ with a large range of singularities and allow $f$ to
scale with $n$. To handle this class of $f$ we develop several new proof
techniques in addition to those used for the Coulomb force.

                                        <span>  In this note, we construct a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, from a Besov space of
functions, to the dual of this class. The Besov spaces are of functions on the
boundary of a bounded, locally compact uniform domain equipped with a doubling
measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality so that this boundary is also
equipped with a Radon measure that has a codimensional relationship with the
measure on the domain. We construct this map via the following recipe. We show
first that solutions to Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplacian on the domain
with prescribed boundary data in the Besov space induce an operator that lives
in the dual of the Besov space. Conversely, we show that there is a solution,
in the homogeneous Newton-Sobolev space, to the Neumann problem for the
$p$-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary data given by a continuous linear
functional belonging to the dual of the Besov space. We also obtain bounds on
its operator norm in terms of the norms of trace and extension operators that
relate Newton-Sobolev functions on the domain to Besov functions on the
boundary.

domain, with $\delta>0$ small enough, possibly with locally infinite surface
measure. Assume also that $\Omega^-= \mathbb R^{n+1}\setminus
\overline{\Omega^+}$ is an NTA domain as well and denote by $\omega^+$ and

$\log\dfrac{d\omega^-}{d\omega^+} \in VMO(\omega^+)$ is equivalent to
$\Omega^+$ being a chord-arc domain with inner normal belonging to
$VMO(H^n|_{\partial\Omega^+})$.

work [Gu-Yung, JFA 281 (2021), 109075]. In particular, we show that under
relatively weak conditions on a metric measure space $(X,d,\nu)$, it holds true
that \[ \bigg[ \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{d(x,y)^{\frac{s}{p}}} \bigg]_{L^p_w(X \times X,
\nu \otimes \nu)} \approx \| u \|_{L^p(X,\nu)}, \] where $s$ is a generalised
dimension associated to $X$ and $[\cdot]_{L^p_w}$ is the weak Lebesgue norm. We
provide some counterexamples which show that our assumptions are optimal.

the notion of transition semigroups to possibly non-Markovian stochastic
processes. We study the basic properties of evolutionary semigroups and, in
particular, prove that they always arise as the composition of the shift
semigroup and a single operator called the expectation operator of the
semigroup. We also prove that the transition semigroup of a Markov process can
always be extended to an evolutionary semigroup on the path space whenever the
Markov process can be realized with the appropriate path regularity. As first
examples of evolutionary semigroups associated to non-Markovian processes, we
discuss deterministic evolution equations and stochastic flows driven by L\'evy
processes. The latter in particular include certain stochastic delay equations.

construct a family of $G$-invariant real-valued functions on $V$ that we call

establish that a suitable coorbit filter bank is injective and locally lower
Lipschitz in the quotient metric at orbits of maximal dimension. Furthermore,
when the orbit space $\mathbb S^{d-1}/G$ is a Riemannian orbifold, we show that
a suitable coorbit filter bank is bi-Lipschitz in the quotient metric.

                                        <span>  We prove that the functional volume product for even functions is monotone
increasing along the Fokker--Planck heat flow. This in particular yields a new
proof of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality by K. Ball and also
Artstein-Avidan--Klartag--Milman in the even case.
  This result is the consequence of a new understanding of the regularizing
property of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. That is, we establish an
improvement of Borell's reverse hypercontractivity inequality for even
functions and identify the sharp range of the admissible exponents. As another
consequence of successfully identifying the sharp range for the inequality, we
derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ inequality for the Laplace transform for even
functions. The best constant of the inequality is attained by centered
Gaussians, and thus this provides an analogous result to Beckner's sharp
Hausdorff--Young inequality.
  Our technical novelty in the proof is the use of the Brascamp--Lieb
inequality for log-concave measures and Cram\'{e}r--Rao's inequality in this
context.

Banach algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$,
and assume that there is a bounded functional calculus for the operator $T$, so
there is a bounded algebra homomorphism mapping functions $f \in \mathcal{A}$
to bounded operators $f(T)$ on $X$. Theorems of Katznelson-Tzafriri type
establish that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \|T^n f(T)\| = 0$ for functions $f \in
\mathcal{A}$ whose boundary functions vanish on the unitary spectrum
$\sigma(T)\cap \mathbb{T}$ of $T$, or sometimes satisfy a stronger assumption
of spectral synthesis. We consider the case when $\mathcal{A}$ is the Banach
algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$ of analytic Besov functions on $\mathbb{D}$.
We prove a Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem for the
$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$-calculus which extends several previous results.

Coulhon-Varopoulos dimension and the spectral dimension of spectral triples
associated to sub-Markovian semigroups (or Dirichlet forms) acting on classical
(or noncommutative) $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces associated to finite measure spaces.
More precisely, we prove that the completely bounded local Coulhon-Varopoulos
dimension $d$ exceeds the spectral dimension and even implies that the
associated Hodge-Dirac operator is $d^+$-summable. We explore different
settings to compare these two values: compact Riemannian manifolds, compact Lie
groups, sublaplacians, metric measure spaces, noncommutative tori and quantum
groups. Specifically, we prove that, while very often equal in smooth compact
settings, these dimensions can diverge. Finally, we show that the existence of
a symmetric sub-Markovian semigroup on a von Neumann algebra with finite
completely bounded local Coulhon-Varopoulos dimension implies that the von
Neumann algebra is necessarily injective.

                                        <span>  We show that the $a$-parameterized family of the generalized
Constantin-Lax-Majda model, also known as the Okamoto-Sakajo-Wunsch model,
admits exact self-similar finite-time blowup solutions with interiorly smooth
profiles for all $a\leq 1$. Depending on the value of $a$, these self-similar
profiles are either smooth on the whole real line or compactly supported and
smooth in the interior of their closed supports. The existence of these
profiles is proved in a consistent way by considering the fixed-point problem
of an $a$-dependent nonlinear map, based on which detailed characterizations of
their regularity, monotonicity, and far-field decay rates are established. Our
work unifies existing results for some discrete values of $a$ and also explains
previous numerical observations for a wide range of $a$.

affine isoperimetric inequalities relating the volumes of a convex body and its
difference body and polar projection body, respectively. Following a classical
work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called
higher-order setting. In this work, we establish the higher-order analogues for
these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions.

                                        <span>  The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of
minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on
disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of
the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative
estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at
one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within
an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities,
including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic
operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These
entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural
engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.

                                        <span>  We prove the first theorem on projections on general noncommutative
$\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces associated with non-type I von Neumann algebras where $1
\leq p < \infty$. This is the first progress on this topic since the seminal
work of Arazy and Friedman [Memoirs AMS 1992] where the problem of the
description of contractively complemented subspaces of noncommutative
$\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces is explicitly raised. We show that the range of a
2-positive contractive projection on an arbitrary noncommutative
$\mathrm{L}^p$-space is completely order isometrically isomorphic to some
noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space. This result is sharp and is even new for
Schatten spaces $S^p$. Our approach relies on non-tracial Haagerup's
noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces in an essential way, even in the case of a
projection acting on a Schatten space and is unrelated to the methods of Arazy
and Friedman
