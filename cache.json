We show that a $C^1$ solution of isentropic Euler equation breaks\ndown if (i) gradient of initial velocity has a negative real eigenvalue at some\npoint $x_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ and (ii) Hessian of initial density satisfies a\nsmallness condition in Sobolev space. Our proof also works for the data which\nfails to satisfy the above-mentioned `integral condition'.

We introduce and\nanalyze several key theorems, including the Drop theorem, the Petal theorem,\nCaristi-Kirk fxed-point theorem, and Takahashi's theorem, all of them within\nthis context. Moreover, we extend the classical Drop theorem and Petal theorem\nto a more generalized setting. We also demonstrate the practical signifcance of\nthese findings through numerous applications to diverse areas of mathematics.\nIn particular, in the context of partial differential equations, we explore\ntheir implications on the solution of the Plateau problem, and in control\ntheory. We also extend the classical Pontyargin maximum principle.\n","authors":["Javier Falco","Daniel Isert"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18467v1.pdf","comment":"20 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18368v1","updated":"2024-03-27T08:58:41Z","published":"2024-03-27T08:58:41Z","title":"The Mercer-Young Theorem for Matrix-Valued Kernels on Separable Metric\n  Spaces","summary":"  We generalize the characterization theorem going back to Mercer and Young,\nwhich states that a symmetric and continuous kernel is positive definite if and\nonly if it is integrally positive definite.

It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using\norder-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties\nassociated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all\nmonads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is\nintroduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally\nconvex) topological vector spaces and their properties. Local properties and\ncompleteness can be defined and characterized effortlessly. Duality theory is\nstudied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate brief and\ninsightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck\ncompleteness without any technicalities.\n","authors":["Niels Charlier","Hans Vernaeve"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18315v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08296v2","updated":"2024-03-27T06:56:35Z","published":"2024-03-13T07:07:22Z","title":"Quasinormability and property $(Î©)$ for spaces of smooth and\n  ultradifferentiable vectors associated with Lie group representations","summary":"  We prove that the spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable vectors associated\nwith a representation of a real Lie group on a Fr\\'{e}chet space $E$ are\nquasinormable if $E$ is so.
